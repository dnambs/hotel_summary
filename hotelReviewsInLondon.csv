"No mini bar at room, no slippers provided. We were forsed to ask more than once for getting missing towl sets, and this happened more than once. Any hotel under Hilton name should provide everything Hilton name is known for: service.",13-Jul-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"The hotel is not really supposed to be walked to - which I find odd in London. It's a rather long walk from the train station that's a bit tricky and not straigh forward. It feels like you're in the middle of nowhere, but then again, the name Docklands doesn't usually conjure up pictures of downtown.The staff is very friendly and welcoming, the rooms are roomy and clean. Don't call the front desk for power and/or towels: the power only works with the key in the slot next to the light switch and the 2. person's towels are in the closet (for whatever reason).Breakfast is included but a mess. They offer everything you'd want to eat and more, but it's presented in such a small space that you have to fight your way through, wait about a 30 minutes for a waffle and if you ever leave your seat, be prepared to lose it in the time it takes you to get another cup of coffee. The most disorganized hotel breakfast I've ever seen.There's a Chinese restaurant and a pub nearby, and the hotel's pub offers some snacks as well.",12-Jul-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Convenient situation for the ExCel. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Noise from the very nearby City Airport was minimal inside. Virtually no amenities in the nearby area, all the cafes & restaurants are on the other side of the ExCel (a long walk).",6-Jul-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"We eventually arrived at the hotel having been given completely wrong directions from central reservations and landed up in not one, but two different Hilton hotels before we reached the correct one. We were fortunately given a free taxi ride, with a little bit of persuasion, from the first wrong hotel as I dread to think how much the fare would have been - probably about £50.The room was clean and the beds very comfortable - nice and hard! The bathroom was good with a very powerful shower but it would have been nice to have somewhere to hang wet towels as had to ask for fresh ones every day as soaking wet.Breakfast was included in the price and very tasty.Not quite so good re lunch. Only snacks available. On the last day I ordered a baked potato which had black bits inside. I asked a member of staff for another one but she came back a few minutes later to tell me all the potatoes were in the same condition. She then asked me what I would like to replace suggesting I had a pizza but I wasn’t prepared to pay the extra price. I opted for a panini with cheese and bacon inside with salad but it wasn’t very appetising. The hotel was well situated opposite London City Airport and about a 3 minute walk from the DLR which made travelling into the City very easy.On my return home I realised I had left my hot water bottle behind which I need for pain relief. I have emailed twice but have had no reply to either emails. Not good.Not sure if I would stay there again.",3-Jul-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"My wife and I are currently heading home on the train after a 4 night stay and we were both chatting about how great a stay we had.The hotel itself is almost new so very clean throughout with little to no signed of wear and tear.It’s a few minutes walk from the Prince Albert DLR station so access to the tube network is a real doddle. Trips to and from the city centre take ball park 40 minutes using the tube and other public transport.The hotel is also very close to London airport, this is not an issue at all as at no time could we hear the planes as they landed and departed, the same applies to the DLR. We found our room especially quiet and as a light sleeper this was a god send (floor 7 room 723).The hotels real strong point was the staff, they really are a credit to the hotel and the Hampton brand, we received a friendly greeting upon arrival and this continued throughout our stay wether at reception, the bar or when crossing paths with the cleaning team! Sincerely I think you would struggle to find better staff elsewhere!!!The only slight negative for us was breakfast, it was very manic so we would grab a quick coffee and dash rather than face the scrum but again the hotel only cost us £84 a night so an overly busy breakfast area doesn’t change the fact that this really is a great hotel for the price and somewhere we will actively look to book next time we are in London.",1-Jul-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"We never been to London before so we did not know how far this hotel is. We took tube from airport and used DLR line to get to the hotel which took us more than an hour because we got lost, quite far from London Center but clean place to stay. We arrive earlier than the check-in time but they checked us in because the room was ready. The people at the hotel were nice and the breakfast was sufficient.",30-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Perfect place to stop for our night in London. Comfy beds and decent breakfast. Next door to DLR and city airport. Onsite parking if you travel by car. Usual expected facilities in rooms, tea, coffee etc. Would recommend. ",29-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"hotel super ok, clean rooms, quiet and spacious, nice staff always ready to help you, very good and rich breakfast.Location is not very good, away from the center and tourist attractions but located in a quiet area",25-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Stayed at this hotel for 2nights, which included breakfast. On arrival we were met by friendly staff and went straight to our room. Our room was all very clean and had everything we needed....apart from, just one little thing - the room could really benefit from a few coat hooks. It's not a moan, because the room was exellent, just a suggestion. Before going out, we had a drink in the bar area, again friendly staff, all good. Breakfast the next morning was lovely, with friendly and helpfull staff. There was a wide choice, ranging from hot food to pastries and fruit. It can get busy at peak times, but there are plenty of different areas to sit. Overall this was a very enjoyable stay and we would book here again. A thankyou to all the staff :)",24-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was nice. Although not enough towels given for the two of us. View was amazing! I made sure to pre-choose the room before arriving to make sure I had a view of the runway - I sure did! I recommend room number 600 if you have the option to choose. Food was good in the hotel, including breakfast. Staff were very nice. Only issue was the fact that I’d asked for a late check out (up to 2pm) and around 11:30am, housekeeping was already knocking on the door, and did so about 3 times before we left (around 12:15pm). We did inform them that we had a late checkout but it was a different person every time. This was annoying, so we left early.Hotel very close to DLR, (Royal Albert). Thanks for a good stay.",16-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Stayed for a night whilst seeing MUSE at London Stadium, Stratford (fairly close by DLR).Great little hotel in a brilliant location opposite London City Airport. If you like wide open spaces and planes, what more do you need? Oh yeah...a Chinese Restaurant across the road. I would definitely recommend. No fuss, clean, friendly staff, late night food served.Would we stay again? Oh yes!!",14-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights along with My parents and brother... We had a twin room and a queen accessible room and they were interconnected... that was a plus... Rooms were of Very decent size.. Plenty of space to move around.. The only thing we found that can be made better is the bedding for the accessible room.. it was a little bit too high for my dad.. Maybe a lower bed in these rooms might be better... Rest of the things was all good... Staff members were pleasant and helpful, buffet breakfast was great...a few restaurants were at a walking distance from where one can enjoy watching planes taking off and landing at the city airport",11-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. Rooms are modern, good sized, clean. Especially liked the large shower and the windows wich let the daylight in.*great gym*delicious breakfast*friendly and welcoming staff*good quality beds*huuuuge towelsOnly minus is that the Dockside area is quiet with not much interesting things to do. (beautiful parks nearby though)",8-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"My daughter and I stayed at the hotel for Comic Con, it was a short walk to the Excel Centre.The room was clean and the beds were comfy and had great pillows.The breakfast was good my daughter enjoyed the waffles.The staff were very helpful.",4-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Great hotel ideal location for us. We didn’t have one complaint at all. The staff were all friendly and wanting to help. The complimentary breakfast was fabulous with my son particularly loving making his own waffles! Can’t wait to return!!,1-Jun-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
The location was ideal to the city airport and local amenities. The subway was close by and easily accessible. Loved our stay here and would recommend this hotel to our friends and family. The rooms were clean and comfortable. ,30-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"We had an absolutely wonderful time at the Hampton. Staff friendly, helpful, and everyday the housekeeping was absolutely spotless. We also accidentally left over £200 on the side and not a single note was touched. Great location for Excel but also the whole of Central London. The breakfast is absolutely wonderful. We stayed for our mini moon and would come again - and again and again! ",30-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Spending five days at the same hotel receiving the same level of service is very pleasing ..breakfast is great this ...hotel is located somewhat out of the city but it is quiet and about 20 minutes by DLR and five minutes walk from the train stop and well priced if you are not paying in pounds,25-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Good hotel for the Excel Arena, has a bar and gym. I would not recommend for a visit to London unless you using the Excel Arena. Some of the rooms are excellent, I was given a disability room which had a lovely view of a brick wall! Service was a little slow, but saying that was very friendly and helpful.",25-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Good hotel for an airport hotel. It’s a Hampton so restaurant facilities are limited. The included breakfast is good. Rooms are clean and modern. Cannot hear any aircraft noise from the room. Staff friendly and courteous. Not much around the hotel other than other hotels and a Chinese opposite. Well worth a stay if you have business in the area or for accessing the airport or eXcel. ,24-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"We spent 3 nights here and felt that the overall experience was extremely positive, particularly keeping in mind that it is a 2* hotel.The staff provided excellent customer service, both on reception and at breakfast.Rooms were a good size with comfortable beds and pillows. You also were able to control the temperature and get a good nights sleep. Despite the planes from City Airport taking off over the hotel, you cannot hear them inside.Breakfast was included and there was a wide range of choices, cooked and continental, along with a selection of teas and good coffee. It would have been nice to have fried rather than scrambled eggs though. We would certainly recommend the waffles.On our first night we had dinner in the bar and whilst the burger tasted good, the chips were oven chips and a bit of a let down.Location-wise, there are not many places to eat nearby, but there is a DLR station at the end of the road (few mins walk), only a couple stops from the Excel Centre and maybe 20mins from Tower Gateway station.Thank you for an enjoyable stay.",11-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Hotel caters for gluten free at breakfast to set the day off, and staff were well briefed on what was and wasn't suitable. Clean and tidy rooms and reception area and well located for the Excel arena where there is a cable car across to the O2. LDR stations near by so getting anywhere is easy.",9-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Stayed here for 2 nights while watching a show at the O2 arena. Great for access to the O2 via the Emirates Skyline. Easy access into London via Thames water taxi or Tube. Rooms were great and clean a d tidy. Breakfast was really nice with enough choice. The staff are friendly and helpful. ,7-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Looks like a newer hotel. very clean, very modern. great breakfast. Gym is pretty good. Bar open until 1. Serves pizzas 24hr.

"The hotel had very efficient staff, the rooms are neat and clean, the food options are limited but we found what we needed, so they cater to everyone. Breakfast was good. It has a tube station nearby that can take you to central london.",3-May-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
I stayed here with my wife and daughter for one night. It’s in a good location for the Excel and London City Airport. It’s also close to the DLR. The room was comfortable with a sofa bed for our daughter on request. The customer service from the staff was excellent and the breakfast was very good.Would definitely stay again.,29-Apr-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Lack of Air-Con control from the room.Cooked Breakfast options a bit limited.Bathroom was cleaner than most other hotels we've stayed at which was a very good plus point.Would've been nice if the Hotel had other leisure facilities, i.e. Pool Steam/Suana etc.",28-Apr-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Nice good value hotel, stayed 5 nights for a convention at excel, very handy 10 min walk, good staff, nice room! BUT!!! Beware parking I had my car stolen on the second night from the hotel car park at the rear! NO CCTV which I find unbelievable! Park close to the hotel entrance!! NOT AT THE REAR!! and by the look of all the glass on the floor I wasn’t the first ",26-Apr-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html

"Stayed at the Hampton for a week whilst on business. The staff are very friendly and courteous. Rooms are very neat and the facilities caters for all types of guests. They have a lovely buffet breakfast included in the rate. Highly recommend especially if you attending an event at ExCel London, as it’s only a short walk to the venue from the hotel",11-Apr-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
My only complaint is that I had to pay a £50 deposit when I checkedin(that I didn't know about when I arrived) but I got it back as soon as I checked out. Great selection and plenty of choice for breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff.,5-Apr-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"This is the 3rd time stopping here as the prices are really good and the location is amazing if you are seeing a show at the 02. The breakfast is always great and free. The rooms are always clean, but on this stay I was annoyed when we can to the day we were checking out. We had a knock on the door, it was the housekeeper telling us our check out was today. This was 10:00am. We told her we know and will be out soon. 11:00 came, another knock housekeeper again asking us when are we leaving. Check out is not till 12:00. I found this inappropriate, I know they have a job to do but we didn't over stay. Maybe the management could let the housekeepers know to know there boundaries for our next visit. I would stay here again as the location is great and great transport link with the DLR and then the tube in Canning Town.

"Clean, comfortable, free breakfast, easy to find. Ticked the box. There's nothing much within walking distance so we ate at hotel which was ok but very limited menu, did the trick for a one night stop over, family room, parking, pleasant staff.

"Stayed for a business trip for 3 nights having previously stayed at The DoubleTree 100 metres away.The lobby and reception area were pretty basic and what you'd expect of Hilton's budget arm.The staff were fantastic when we checked in and more than accommodating throughout. The breakfast was great for me (always opt for continental) however my colleague said the cooked was lacking a little.The rooms were better than the aforementioned hotel across the road; clean, bright, spacious and very well specced.For the price you pay I would definitely recommend staying here.",22-Mar-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Stayed here on a number of occasions. It is very hand for LCY airport and indeed for the ExCel Conference facilities. Rooms are simple, clean and beds are comfortable. I choose a high corner room as you get a view of the airport and up the river too. Breakfast was sufficient for my needs, wifi was a simple click to get on instead of trying to get a password etc, and staff were friendly and willing to help.My digital room key half worked - It opened the floor door but not my bedroom door, so only snag of the stay.Visited the Chinese 100 yards away and had a very good meal.I've returned a few times and even taken my family there too as was convenient for the Emirates sky cable car and easy to get into/out of London and lower cost of being in town.",14-Mar-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Good budget option for VidCon London at Excel.10 minutes walk To East side of Venue.Clean room, comfy beds. Fine for 2 night stay.Breakfast was ok. Pastries were a bit hard. Waffles great.It was hard finding places open late for dinner. It is quite a walk through Excel Centres far side.",11-Mar-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"My second stay and definitely my go to hotel when i need to stay over in town. While it’s a little way out from the city, I found it as I refused to pay over £200 for a travel lodge!!! It’s very well equipped and includes a decent breakfast buffet. Very good value for money. If you’re using City Airport or visiting the Excel it’s ideally located. Staff were really friendly and attentive. The beds in the room were super comfortable. Room and bathroom is well equipped. Will definitely be back.

"We returned to this hotel because it is convenient for O2. Having stayed before we knew what to expect, and the rooms, lobby, breakfast were all good.The thing that makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Everyone we came across was friendly and helpful. We really felt that they had time for us, and were prepared to make an extra effort to do whatever we needed and more.",7-Mar-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"A great hotel, just a few minutes from ExCel, so it was very convenient. It has all the services and amenities you need. Friendly staff and the rooms are lovely and spacious for working and chilling out.",28-Feb-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"For Central London, to have great quality at this price (my last minute booking for a queen room was around 90 pounds) is outstanding. The Hotel is recently refurbished to a very high standard. The doors are heavy, so the soundproofing is excellent. The linen was fresh and clean and extremely comfortable. Wi Fi is free and the staff are very well-trained and helpful. The free breakfast buffet was good with thick bacon and lovely sausages. The only very minor downsides were that the only prepared fruit at breakfast were those horrible canned mandarin segments, and the rooms were slightly on the small side. But all-in-all this place is outstanding value and comfort and I am definitely going again.",21-Feb-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Modern clean hotel all rooms have modern showers top spec. Big buffet breakfast- there’s about 5 hotels in a row I popped and looked in all of them pick this one. Also internet free and easy dinner food pizza jacket pots etc and good sofa lounge area.

"My family loves staying at the Hampton by Hilton in the US. The breakfasts are worth it on their own, but the rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff if helpful and friendly, and the overall value is very high. This experience was no different, and solidifies my loyalty to this brand. Everything you might want in a hotel for your family.",19-Feb-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"First of all, the location - this hotel is in a great location for London City Airport and the Excel, O2 Arena, or even Canary Wharf etc. DLR is approx 5 minute walk away for transport into London. Note the DLR from City Airport is a different line, so you need to walk (5-10 mins) or get a cab.Breakfast, complimentary buffet style breakfast. A good selection, fresh and plentiful, layout a bit odd and bit of a free-for-all, but good nonetheless. Unfortunately, that's about it for positive comments.There is no restaurant at this hotel, they offer bar snacks, but you will need to go further afield for 'proper' food. I asked if they had any sort of deals / link-up with the DoubleTree (another Hilton brand) across the road, and got a 'no of course not' sort of response.The free Wifi was very slow and pretty much unusable. Didn't test the premium Wifi. Reception advised the signal isn't great in some areas, but was able to use the business centre computers instead.The bed was pretty firm, yet the pillows far too soft, so you just sank into them. Mattress slipped away from headboard if you tried to sit up in bed, to read etc. Duvet cover was torn, and towels were worn and freyed.The room was clean and neatly presented, though the shower tray in the bathroom was worn and looked grubby/dirty. Otherwise the bathroom was also clean and tidy.Air-conditioning was a nightmare. It was set to 29 degrees (C) on arrival, and the room was very warm. We turned it down to 20 (a reasonably comfortable temperature) and it just started blasting out cold air, eventually we switched it off when the room had cooled down. However we were woken in the middle of the night sweltering hot as it had reset itself back to 29 degrees and the room was like an oven. Again, we turned it down and it blasted out cold air until we switched it off. This happened each night we were there.I raised the issue of the aircon with reception, didn't really get an apology, just excuses such as it must have 'got stuck' on a previous guests settings and that they would reset it. This did not resolve the issue, and nobody bothered to actually check with us if it had or not.Advised reception again about it the following morning, was advised maintenance would look at it the following day!Overall, we had 3 nights of broken sleep in what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend away. This felt like a stay at a poor budget hotel, I expected much more from a Hilton branded property.",17-Feb-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Lovely room, super bathroom, friendly staff and the complimentary breakfast was the best in a hotel of this size I've had in ages. Handy for ExCel. £15 for parking. Will definitely stop again if in the area.",15-Feb-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"I stayed here with my partner for one night on a Saturday as we were seeing a show at the O2 arena. We paid £84 through booking.com which was very good value.This hotel is in a really clean, quiet and safe area opposite London City Airport and is just a few mins walk from the Royal Albert DLR station. We had a queen room which was really clean and tidy, although the net curtain was a bit dirty but this is just a small gripe. There is heating/air con, big shower, huge tv, desk, hairdryer, tea/coffee and all the other stuff you’d expect.The breakfast was really good with lots of choice. They don’t offer room service meals but they have a 24/7 hot snacks service you can order at the bar - the wait for this was quite long but the food was tasty enough for a simple panini. They also do pizza, nachos etc.I’d definitely stay here again for the O2 as it’s really easy to get there from the hotel, and the price was excellent.

"Lovely hotel , excellent breakfast, excellent menu for all other times of day , great customer service , hotel very good position for tube ( g l r Albert dock ) hotel is new and it is a great place to stay for all London attractions , parking available at extra cost but well worth it ,will stay here when we visit London again .",30-Jan-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Friday night stay.€88.Arrived into London City airport - short 5 minute walk across the Thames to this absolute GEM of a hotel.Extremely fast check-in by some of the most friendly and professional staff I've ever encountered.Room was huge, with very comfortable King Sized Bed.Large Flatscreen TV with excellent selection of channels.Spotless WC with power shower.Basic toiletries supplied - perfect!I was starving when I arrived, so I ordered a pizza from the kitchen (they don't do room service - you have to collect your order from the bar downstairs)Couldn't believe how quickly the delicious pizza was cooked and ready for collection.Washed it down with a nice pint of IPA Slept like a log in a really comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. Can't believe how comfortable it was - seriously!Up for breakfast next morning. It's a buffet style affair, but there's plenty of hot food and cold options available.So...that's all the good things.Now, the downside.......Hold on a minute - there's NO downside.This place is perfect.Its part of the Hilton Chain and, I'm guessing aimed at families, but don't let any part of that put you off.This establishment is truly tremendous....and not just the accommodation and facilities.It's always nice to see smiling staff who are attentive to a customers needs. it's a huge 10/10 from me Great work.....see you again soon!",16-Jan-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Coming from the North it is easily accessible (M6 M1 M25 M11 North Circular) Facilities were fine for a budget type hotel. Decent all you can eat breakfast, and five minute walk to the nearest DLR station",7-Jan-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"I didn't book the hotel myself as it was booked through work, so I didn't know what to expect.The hotel could have more parking spaces available, but land likely doesn't permit this so that's fair enough.The hotel staff were nice, check in was easy, and the reception/lobby was very nice. The room was also lovely. Clean, good sized comfortable bed, big TV and big shower which had good temperature.I was a little worried about the airport, but all the planes stopped flying over around 10pm.There is a pub a 2 minute walk away if you don't want to eat at the hotel, too.Overall, good hotel! :)",3-Jan-19, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Overall, this hotel will do. It's a far ride to the city, about 40 min to central London but the subway isn't hard to use and there's a DLR stop close by. The breakfast is also acceptable as the eggs are those premade powdered kind and tasted pretty gross, but it was free. What I would say is that I didn't see any of the staff smile or seem to be friendly the entire 5 days we were here. They weren't rude, but they weren't especially nice either. We had a small issue with our cards not working on our last night and the manager came out to help and explain that I only booked for 4 days, almost to the point of blaming me for the issue with the cards but not quite. When I showed him my confirmation for 5, he just dismissed the whole thing without further comment and we recieved our cards back, now working. We weren't wished a nice evening, no apology for the inconvenience, no smile. Not a requirement at a hotel in my opinion, but still. I don't ask for much from a hotel, hardly ever drink the free waters or use the coffee pots, and never in my life have I ordered room service but this trip I had a bit of a cold and looked for some of those extra things that make a hotel stay more comfortable. There is no water or ice machine, have to buy water downstairs. There is no fridge in the room. There is no room service. I asked on our last night to use a microwave to warm dinner brought back to the hotel, as we got back early to prepare for an early departure the next day (also knowing there's no room service) , and of course there isn't one for guests. Outside of the lack of hospitality, the walls are very thin and I had to go myself to our next door neighbors, who were in town for a basketball tournament, to ask them to quiet down at around 12am. Stay here if this is a great deal, but I'd recommend looking around and paying a few extra dollars to be closer to the city.

"The beds were a night mare, still up at 2:30, all good though cause got breaky in the morning, the hotel staff were helpful and very approachable, I recommend this hotel but might have a better sleep on the floor...",27-Dec-18, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"I was invited to this place by management after not being able to get food at their sister hotel across the road.reception staff fairly warm and welcoming bar one or two who choose to be a little distant and snooty.Hotel looks nice and the foyer area is very well comfortable. I like the decor and the ambiance of the place, its a well set up operation and I find few foibles bar the fact they jack the prices up during comic con expo week to levels that are near extortionate the two times per year the expo takes place.Why should we be subsiding airport flight cancellation stopovers which is these hotels meat and veg. I remind Hampton owners that a lot of people who go to comic con are disabled and cannot afford much.The breakfast at £10 is to scream for totally marvellous value for money against the others. Hot and cold buffet breakfast with a waffle maker and toppings galore.My only critique no decaffeinated coffee in the electronic dispenser hot drinks machine, that is a very big no no.This article would have been 4 stars if for one thing? The member of breakfast staff going around shouting and pushing their weight about with the customers and by the way when you let your family in i.e. husband and children to eat food with the customers (presumable they haven't paid) one suggests you keep a low profile and try to cease throwing the proverbial doll out of the pram. It isn't a perk of the job when its affecting resident paying customers and this member of staff stuck out like a sore thumb it was so blatantly obvious.You let yourself down Hampton on one small straw issue that broke the camels back.The management need to get a grip quite fast as you're having the jest taken out of you.This article is my own personal opinion and perception based on two meal visits over two days there a paying customer in a party of 5 at £100 in total.",27-Dec-18, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
Stayed here for business. Chose a flexible booking but told that only counted upto the day I booked. Quite disappointing but it was on the booking form. Very limited menu in the 'restaurant' that's mostly Iceland frozen specials by the look of it.Room OK but cold when getting back from work. Keep finding hairs in the shower and on the carpet that aren't mine but that's just par for the course in UK hotels I did have an extra card but that was taken by the cleaners on the first day. There are other options that are available in the vicinity that do the same thing but better. Found most of the staff to be friendly and helpful but not all. Won't be going back if I can help it.OK for London if you are paying 'discounted' price but certainly not worth the usual rates.,19-Dec-18, Hampton by Hilton London Docklands,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12031854-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_London_Docklands-London_England.html
"Hotel is new, well kept, really good breakfast, friendly staff and 5 minutes walk from the nearest DLR station.

"Decamped to this hotel for a weeks stay recently.It is situated right opposite Canning Town transport interchange so getting anywhere is very easy.The hotel has no formal reception, just staff with PDAs. I was met by two ladies who sorted my room card out and I was unpacking in a matter of minutes. When I was in the cafe area later guests were struggling to check in as apart from the bar staff nobody was around.My room was facing the main road and transport hub so was very noisy if I wanted the window open. Aircon was very slow to get going, taking 20/30 minutes to start to pump out cooled air, not good when the temperature was 28 degrees!!The shower was good and powerful, and the bathroom clean. The bed was an absolute joke. Obviously a super cheap mattress had seen better days so a thin topper had been put on top which slipped around if you turned over, and was just plain inadequate for the job.Decent wifi and USB charging points in the room were welcome.My room was serviced every day except one, when the maid was still cleaning at 5pm, so I just got clean towels from her.Bar/cafe area was set out well, non-guests seem to make up a large number of visitors, but somewhere to sit was always free when I wanted it.All in all a decent budget hotel in a good location.",10-Jul-19, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"The hotel is a rather new one. The rooms are big enough for London standards and really clean. Even the bathrooms where an appropriate size.Most basic amenities are available.Check in is a bit confusing since the staff does everything by smartphone, you have to find them.Only thing I didn't like was the breakfast. Everything was plentiful and looked nice but the taste was very bland. Also quality was not great, cheap sausages and eggs. Also for the size of the hotel they would need a much bigger bar area or more separate tables.But all in all I would stay here again for the nice rooms and the convenience of the easy access to the tube.",27-Jun-19, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"Needed a clean, comfortable and welcoming hotel where everything works well. Found the Ibis on Jubilee Line, close to O2 and turns out we had an amazing stay.

"I had been searching for a clean, well priced, comfortable hotel near an underground station close to the 02 arena...and this hotel checks all the boxes!!The hotel is clean, modern and rooms are fresh and comfortable and Canning Town underground and bus station is literally just across the road from the main entrance.If, like us, we were at an event at the O2 then you can see it from the hotel it is that close to the hotel and only one step on the underground on the Jubilee line.There is a lift covering all 9 floors so if any of your party have mobility issues or are just simply tired after a long day no need to struggle up flights of stairs.The twin room we had tea/coffee making facilities, a small closet to hang up clothes, a hairdryer and a big flat screen TV on the wall. The room also had plenty of power points to charge multiple devices if needed.The toilet/shower room is sleek and modern and even has a shower seat attached to the wall if needed.The area around the hotel is less tourist than other places and personally although the food in the in-hotel restaurant was tasty and well priced for London I found the menu to be a little basic there are plenty places to eat and shop at the O2 less than 5 mins away and the high street across the road has a Co-Op and restaurants. Breakfast is available at a cost but chose not to take it as didn’t appear much vegan choices but to be fair I didn’t ask.Great customer service and would highly recommend.

"We stayed for 3 nights and were glad to see that everything here is as good as it was during our previous visit. The only remark we could have is that tables in the evening aren't cleaned very quickly and properly, so you get your drink from the bar and you're standing in front of tables full of dirt and leftovers, having nowhere to sit. But to be honest, this phenomenon didn't happen in the mornings, probably because of Tahir, the super-friendly breakfast guy who seems to take care of everything and everyone in the most efficient way - always with a smile. (No surprise he was the only hotel employee we could recall from our last year's visit.)

The only thing that doesn't make my review excellent was the fact our room neighbours were very noisy, playing loud music and shouting from 6pm - to 3am and there were no staff around to tackle this. I completely realise and understand that the behaviour of their customers is not their fault but possibly a few corridor checks could combat any anti-social behaviour and make visiting the hotel comfortable for all customers, not just those who are young and like to get drunk and have a party in their rooms.",9-Apr-19, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"Stayed for three nights at this hotel so that I could attend meetings near the Tower of London and at the IET, Savoy Place. Staff were very welcoming and I had a nice relatively quiet room on the fifth floor. I had breakfast each day, which as with most hotels is a little pricey, but you can eat as much as you want and there is a variety of food on offer. Unfortunately I didn't try food in the evenings, but other people seemed to find it OK. If you want to go out to eat, there is a nice Italian restaurant about 5 minutes walk down the road and there may be other restaurants near by. Access to public transport is very good, with the Jubilee Line giving access to Westminster and the western part of London, whilst the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) provides frequent access to London City Airport, the Excel Centre, and central London view Tower Hill.",18-Mar-19, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"Very nice modern hotel located across the tube station. The area is being completely regenerated with City Island being constructed just across the bridge. It only takes 15-20 min to get to Green Park on the Jubilee line so easy access to the city. There are a just a few restaurants within walking distance including Zzetta Soul Fired Pizza, but then again London has so much to offer. Rooms are nice and modern, lounge downstairs is also very nice with a bar that is open late. Breakfast is ok for GBP 10.40. Typical 3 star hotel buffet breakfast, we went twice but the first time was better than the last. You have to pay upfront for it.Most of the people who work there are very young (and seem a little unexperienced) but friendly from all parts of the world. The only negative I could find is that the hotel promotes to be environmentally friendly, however they still use tons of plastic, have plastic spoons and cups in the room even wrapped in plastic. There are also no recycling bins available. They say they treasure the environment by not replacing towels unless you want them too, however even though we never put the towels on the bathroom floor they still replaced them every day.

"EXTREMELY small rooms. Same with washroom.I stayed 20 nights with them at a stretch. Very difficult to keep luggage, not even a proper almirah present in the room. I stayed for 20 nights at a stretch with them and when I asked for a couple of hours late checkout on the past day, they refused very rudely citing the charges constantly.It might make sense for some if the nighly charges drop and they are only staying couple of nights, but please make sure that you have an idea of what the room size is. Not suited for longer stays for sure whatever the price maybe.

"Nice, stylish hotel and a perfect location for exploring London. The subway station is directly opposite the hotel and you need around 15min to arrive in the center of the city.

"All areas of this modern, stylish hotel were very clean. The modern way of checking people in, worked well. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. A special mention must be made of the help Tahir gave us. We were a family group staying to attend a funeral. I asked Tahir if some food could be made available for our return. He reserved one of the larger tables for our use and it was set beautifully. He also arranged for pizzas, baguettes and sandwiches to made for our group. He and all the bar staff helped make a difficult day easier.",16-Jan-19, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"I have stayed here a few times, it’s fairly new, rooms are clean and perfectly comfortable.

"I stayed there for the new year. The hotel is a bit far from where the actions are but its close proximity to Canning Town station beats all. The hotel is just across the street from the tube station, from where you can take the Jubilee line or DLR to Central London, O2 or Westfield Stratford. Room is small but clean, quiet and with all the basic necessities that I need.

Needed emergency accomodation after other venue let us down last minute. Have stayed with other Accor hotels before in other locations. Utterly reliable! Easy to book.

"I've spent there 3 nights last week and the only description which fits it's ... FANTASTIC !New structure (clean and cosy), great price, good breakfast, fair space rooms (the shower is bigger than most of the complete bathrooms I've been in London) and of course location (underground stop is just on the opposite side of the street at only 20 min from the centre).I will be surely back and I completely recomend it!",11-Dec-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"This is one of the new style ibis hotels without a reception desk. Instead you are greeted by wandering staff with a company shirt and touch pad to check you in.I arrived at 8:30pm and on inquiring was told the restaurant was open until 10pm and then thereafter there would be their 24 hour menu. I went to my room to do an hour's work and came down to eat just before 9:30pm. When I could eventually attract the attention of the bar staff (how can 3 staff so studiously ignore a customer at the bar) I was told they had shut the restaurant early and there was no food (and no apology).I spoke to the reception staff, who told me the restaurant wasn't their responsibility and if I wanted some food I should try going outside and looking down the high street. I ended up with a sandwich from the local co-op.Now my real complaint is not that the restaurant shut early - for all I know there might have been a good reason. The problem is no one cared. No apology from the restaurant staff, no apology from the hotel staff. Indeed no one in charge who seemed at all concerned about the well-being of residents.I use ibis quite frequently, and generally across Europe they are a reliable chain of hotels. But this particular hotel is one I shall avoid in the future.",7-Dec-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"Located directly facing the Canning Town Tube/DLR station and bus terminal, this hotel is perfect for anyone attending the O2. It is a new hotel so everything is clean, bright and sparkling. Minimal but appropriate décor makes the room compact and attractive.Check in/out is a bit weird as you think you are walking into a restaurant, as indeed you are. No obvious reception area is to be seen, only what appears to be waiters and waitresses standing around. Look closer at their red attire and you will see Reception printed on them.Staff - very welcoming but the lack of a focal point does create problems. When busy, customers tend to mill around the reception person and it can be a bit of ‘loudest and most aggressive is next’. Arriving early we were given the choice of leaving our luggage free of charge or access to the room a few hours in advance of normal booking for a cost (£10) - Ryanair policies live at Ibis.Room was more than adequate for short stays but I certainly wouldn’t want to have a lengthy residence in what is a small but well laid out accommodation. Desk, wall mounted desk lamp which doubles as the main room light, tea making facilities, hair drier and easy access power point complete with 2 USB points & TV are all supplied with free Wi-fi throughout.Beds are very comfortable and the room was well soundproofed as the area is on the flight path of some pretty large jets. Lifts to all floors controlled by key car.Although we didn’t eat in the restaurant or have a drink at the bar, it did seem that the food was popular but the bar offering a bit limited.General - an excellent value for money hotel.",5-Dec-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
First time here. Loved it! Excellent staff. Excellent breakfast. Excellent room. Really impressed. My only complaint would be the placement of the power outlet at the mirror. It should definitely be up higher with a little shelf for a flat iron etc. Other than that its spot on. ,30-Nov-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"Nice enough hotel with good rooms and pleasant staff.There is no reception, but staff with I Phone / Tablet will check you in in the entrance, check in is no problem.But Breakfast is a real pain, There is one queue or Maul with people trying to get okayed for breakfast and others trying to check out, the first morning of my stay it was almost impossible to get out of the lift because of people massed in this area.Breakfast was very poor, its a find yourself a table, find plate and cutlery etc, then find food.What is on offer is nice enough, cereal and breads / Pastries. A toaster if you want toast, and an Egg boiler device with no instructions. Hence at least one person trying to eat a raw egg not realising its cook it yourself.Fresh fruit and yogurt was available with a huge dish of frozen solid red fruits to top your choiceThe Hot offerings look nice enough but because so much is prepared in advance and left piled high under so called heat lamps, the two breakfast i had were best described as warm. The second morning not warm enough to eat.The bacon was terrible - (I have had better bacon in Benidorm) and served laying in 2cm of grease in the serving dish.They also do not seem to have enough salt and pepper pots to go around.The Hotel is Very handy for Canning Town Station and only 2 stops away from Excel.The morning rush and breakfast lets this reasonable hotel down. If they could sort out breakfast so its easier to serve yourself, and make it possible to eat food that is hot my opinion of this hotel would rise.",21-Nov-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html

"I wrote a previous review about the service in the lobby. While disappointing because we waited outside banging on the door while the night staff were at the bar, the service markedly improved for the remainder of the stay. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. They didn’t mind putting our stuff in the safes and they tried to make us comfortable. The room is small as is the bathroom, but that’s to be expected for London hotels. The property is updated and clean, and the breakfast was amazing. They met my expectations so I’m revising my earlier review. Well done, Ibis.",9-Nov-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"Nice new hotel that has a vibrant ground floor area that combines the feel of a cafe and an Apple genius bar with a normal hotel foyer. Modern rooms and novel power extension and charger were welcome, as was the roomy shower rooms (something Ibis has slipped on in the past).It has a number of glitches though. The lack of a delineated reception area coupled with insufficient staff numbers and unclear directions on how to check in, ask for help or check out was incredibly frustrating. Terrible pizza and technical issues with door locks also didn't help. If Ibis sorts out these challenges, this would be a great hotel but beware, patience is needed if you stay there in the short term. I look forward to issuing five stars at some point in the future - just not right now.",8-Nov-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"It's the first time we had used a hotel with no reception desk, which is a bit disconcerting. We were asked to sit at a table and wait. The reception seems to be run on smart phones! When we were seen the check was very efficient.Our room was an accessible room and would have worked reasonably well for a wheelchair user. It had a bit more space than the standard rooms according to the plan. The bathroom was a wet room, and again spacious. The bed was very comfortable, although the pillows were a bit hard. There were only two tea bags, and the requested replacements never appeared. The towels could be better.Breakfast for £10 is good value and the buffet has most things. When it did get busier it became a bit chaotic.The staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a useful place to stay, but not for more than one or two nights.",6-Nov-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"Clean and modern hotel. You can tell they are fairly new and have kept the place in top shape. I enjoyed being so close to the Canning Town undeground/DLR station especially on those rainy days. Can get into central London in about 20 mins and easy to get to. Room is very basic- firm bed- more like mattress topper, clean bathroom, and I appreciated the 2 usb plugs provided/hair dryer. Didn't have enough hangers for the small closet but worked it out. Only thing I would suggest is providing a wash cloth with the towels, I had to go out and buy my own. Air conditioning was decent but wished heat went a little higher- was cold one of the rainy nights. Housekeeping was egar to clean my room but did not need services- they provided toilet paper when needed. Breakfast was a great variety for the price- 10.40 pounds, the attendant was friendly and helpful. If you want hot and fresh go around 7 am- no one awake then really. Anything after good luck, it gets busy. The day I arrived was on a Saturday and place was swamped with check in and outs. I would suggest getting more staff during those busy times- the staff seemed to be annoyed with everyone and not very friendly at first. If you arrive before check in and there are no rooms available you can leave your luggage and check in later. I read other reviews to ask for a room regardless and you can pay 10 pounds to magically get into one. It worked. You have to insist you will pay and they will confirm that there is a room available, even if they say it's full at first. Glad it worked for me due to flying for 13 hours and needing sleep. Quiet place for the most part, but if you have loud neighbors you can hear the door slam in your room and will think the neighbors are trying to get into your door. Someone had left a dirty sock on my door one night because I had the do not disturb sign up, pretty sure it was drunk people or kids playing a prank. The lock on my door did not work from the inside but no one came into my room the 6 days I stayed. If you are looking for a clean place to stay, close to the underground, reasonable price, and don't mind the bare necessities I would recommend this place. Also, if you are looking for late night food the bar stops selling food at 9:30 pm. They only have a few options to sell afterwards- crisps, soda, and frozen pizza. Did not get the pizza. You are better off getting snacks and having them in your room. Also, if you are leaving early morning the doors are locked and you have to press a button to get out next to the door. Staff around the morning time usually were busy doing other things.",30-Oct-18, Ibis London Canning Town,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12938460-Reviews-Ibis_London_Canning_Town-London_England.html
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and overall were mostly happy with our stay. The hotel is in a great location very close to multiple transport links (central line London Underground, London Overground and buses) which is very handy for moving around London.On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by friendly staff and check in was quick and easy. There are lifts serving all floors. The room is basic (as expected) and was clean. The bed was comfortable. We did not eat any meals in the hotel.Our only issues seemed to centre around the bathroom. The shower had very poor water pressure and at the highest temperature was just about warm. Only one towel for each person was provided and no hand towel so you have to use the towels for drying hands then use them damp to dry yourself after the shower while your wet hair is dripping down your back. The towels are also extremely poor quality. They are grey, thin and threadbare. I certainly wasn’t expecting pure white fluffy towels, but these have definitely seen better days and should be replaced. All in all, we were happy with our stay and would book again.

Stayed here one night. Great location for Westfield shopping centre and the 'tube'. The Hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was ok but hot drinks machine not working. The room..... very basic is it shown in the photos on website. The bathroom was weird.... had to step up into it.... I felt like I was in a caravan. The towels!!!!! what can I say other than they need throwing away and investment in linen needs to be done. We got one bath towel each. No hand towel which I found strange. The 'bath' towel itself must have been white at some time... but after numerous washes was now 'grey' and see through.... it was so thin I could see through it. Tea & coffee making facilities in room great with a kettle that boils fast. would have liked a tea spoon though instead of a wooden stirrer stick.,25-Jun-19, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html

"I recently visited the ibis hotel in Shepherd’s Bush for a birthday treat after seeing Jess Glynne at the 02 empire. My daughter booked ahead and informed them it was my birthday (unbeknown to me) On arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find in my room birthday balloons, chocolates, a card and a gift all set up for me. This was such a lovely little touch and much appreciated. The rooms was lovely and we had a nice comfortable stay. The following morning we went down for a lovely buffet breakfast and again the staff surprised me with some chocolates and a slice of cake with a candle in it and sang me Happy Birthday!

This is not an opulent hotel, but if you are in London and you will be out most of the time, this a good choice. My only concern is that even in this cold weather the hotel was really hot, we had to ask for an extra fan to be put inside our room. Also the “double” bed for 02 adults is pretty small, there were a lot of noise from outside because of a fair going on nearby but that happened because we had to keep the window a little open for ventilation.

"Perfect hotel if you are attending a gig at O2 Empire as it is across the road. The hotel was clean, modern and adequate for one night away. Staff at reception (Paul) was very friendly but night staff are rude and have no manners. You get the impression the hotel is run my foreign teenagers who simply can't be bothered, they appear very lazy indeed.The breakfast is shockingly bad, cold, rubbery, nasty overcooked food. the hash browns looked like 3 days old and sausages sitting in hot plate for hours. the scrambled eggs had started to go black around the edges. When i asked for some new hot food to be brought out it was received with a huge sigh and i can't be bothered look on their faces. I couldn't finish the breakfast as it was probably the worse i have ever tasted.

"I used to be a regular at the Ibis in Euston, I was really sad when that got closed as it had been my go to hotel in London when I needed to stay over. I like Ibis as a brand, the hotels aren't fancy, but they're usually clean, with comfortable beds and a lot of them have walk-in showers. I had a concert at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire and so I was pleased to see there was an Ibis conveniently close to both the venue and the Tube station. My room was very large, far larger than I've had in other Ibis hotels and it had laminate flooring rather than carpet. I thought that might make it noisier, but I didn't notice any noise from above during my stay, though that said, it was a Sunday night, so I doubt the hotel was full. There was the usual pod-style bathroom with the walk-in shower which you get in the more modern Ibis hotels. I like them, the shower floor is sloped just enough so the whole room doesn't get wet and the double doors make it easy getting in and out. The bed was comfortable and the temperature was fine. I appreciated being able to open the window as I like it to be cool at night. Given a choice that's the one improvement I'd make to the Ibis hotels - air conditioning. The system they use can't really cope in the summer when it gets hot, but they do at least usually have a fan available in the room which helps. I didn't stay for breakfast, but I did have a drink in the bar. They do Camden Town Brewery beer on tap, so you can get a decent pint there. All in all, it was pretty much what I expect from an Ibis, clean, comfortable and good value, the brand continues to live up to what I expect.",29-Jan-19, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"Went to see Charles Easton in concert and stayed here for one night with friends. Greeted by friendly staff with a sense of humour and found all staff that we encountered were friendly and helpful. Very clean and smart looking and so close to where we needed to be and also close to tube station.Rooms spacious, comfortable, clean and quiet. Didn't have breakfast but nice touch was a basket of croissants/choc au pain sat on the counter for customers which we had on arrival with a cup of coffee. Would definately stay again.",22-Jan-19, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
Pleasent staff makes such a differens. Felt very welcome here. Good Ibis standard as you would expect. Really good value. Lots of small shops and deli/restaurants in the area. Nice location close to the underground system.

"This hotel's location is very convenient and staff are friendly. Room was clean enough, but only lower point was shower head holder was broken, and not possible to fix during our stay. Hotel staff was arranging other room to move, but there was no same size room, so we didn't move and stayed in same room, finally.",11-Jan-19, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
Two night stay between Christmas and New Year. Good room on 3rd floor suited our needs on location as tube station close by. No issues at all.Slept very well with no noise from busy road outside or other visitors .Had breakfast and parked in Westfields shopping centre as cheaper.,1-Jan-19, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
I got a good rate on 2 rooms for 2 nights over Dec 24th and 25th 2018. Family live nearby and it was the perfect solution. The rooms are clean and the bed comfortable. The breakfast looked very tasty and was not expensive at all. Staff friendly and the area is great for shopping and the tube is handy for central London. All in all a great choice and one I would recommend for a basic hotel for short stays.,27-Dec-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"I had a lovely 3 nights at the Ibis London Shepherds Bush. The location was perfect, a couple of blocks away from the Central line and an easy trip into the city center.The neighborhood is a wonderful multicultural community with lots of great restaurant options.Hotel amenities were pretty minimal which was to be expected for the price. The room was clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable. That's personally all I need in an accommodation. I'm a very low maintenance traveler.Overall, I would not hesitate to book at the Ibis Shepherds Bush again the next time I'm in London.",9-Dec-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html

"Hotel is in a perfect location for a trip to Shepherds Bush Empire, and was delighted to find out on arrival that it is a stones throw away from the Westfield shopping centre. For the location the two night stay was very reasonably priced.Rooms are clean and functional with a good sized shower cubicle. Staff were very friendly and helpful.Only criticisms are that the towels are very small, about the same size as my hand towels at home, and the room was extremely warm, despite it being November, with it appearing the aircon disabled, and even with the thermostat set on minimum and the window open as far as the restrictor would allow, it was still too warm at the end of our two day stay. If not for these two points, I would have awarded a 5*.",3-Dec-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"Was welcomed by Paul who was lovely on reception and let us check in half hour early. Room excellent and clean, the air con was not the best so a little hot overnight and too noisy to open the window. But it is a great location close to the central line, lots of places to eat and drink nearby as well as the Westfield shopping centre which I am told is fab. They do breakfast but we ate over the road on the way to the tube station.

The hotel is great but more importantly the staff are so friendly & helpful! ! They continue to communicate with you if you have any questions or queries they do all they can to help .certainly went a little extra to put balloons & card in daughters room. And in place like london (knightmare to drive into) so so helpful having carpark attached to hotel walk out car with bags straight into hotel door .loads of shops & earing places on doorstep .Fantastic,25-Nov-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"I stayed here for one night and it was dreadfully overpriced. The room needed refurbishment, the TV didn’t function and the rom also had one of those horrible “ plastic cell “ bathrooms. Simply too much money for such a poor room.

"Only stay here if you have low expectations and just need somewhere to sleep. Good points - near the tube, quiet, cheap parking at nearby Westfield centre, not too expensive (£130 b&b for 2), check in at 2 check out at 12.

Here are the picture of the fish and chips served to us today at the Ibis hotel. The batter was burnt and the fish inside was grey not white as it should be and it was served with mixed veg and not the mushy peas we ordered.I would not serve this to my dog and when we complained and asked the guy who served us would he eat it he said no way but he did nothing else.,4-Nov-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
Stayed for one night to attend one conference. One of the best Ibis hotel. Way ahead than many Ibis hotel in this area. Definitely recommend. newly built. cleanliness top notch. Short walk to restaurants and tube stations. ,4-Nov-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"Booked a London Package for our 20th anniversary and didn’t get to choose the accommodations. When we heard 2 weeks out that this was our Property, we were disappointed that it wasn’t located closer to Central London. BUT, it was a very close walk to the shepherd bush-Central Line station which made it more convenient. Many amenities close by as well, restaurants, pharmacy, shopping mall. The staff were all so friendly, the breakfast was an amazing start to each day - so much variety, great coffee & tea selection. If I return to London I will try to stay closer to the heart of the fun but if you don’t mind crazy busy subway stations, this is a decent choice. All in all LOVED LONDON!

"My wife and I normally stay here when in West London and have always had a very good experience, as have the relatives who have taken up out recommendation of staying here.Our last visit must have something to do with French revenge for the BREXIT campaign. Things had deteriorated since our last stay. My negative review has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the staff who were polite and extremely helpful.On entering our room, everything was as we expected, clean and tidy. A typical generic Ibis room. Immediately, we were hit by the overpowering smell of whatever the room was cleaned with. Was it a masking agent or just over zealous use of disinfectant? Because we were only staying one night and it was quite late we decided to brave it out. Terrible mistake. We couldn't sleep and we were left with only one option which was to open the window. The noise of the air-conditioning units and traffic certainly diluted the smell but the cost was a noisy and disturbed night. When we returned home our clothes wreaked of the disinfectant?? smell as did our suitcase. To add insult to injury, when we tried to make a coffee we found that our milk curdled the drink. Long life milk past its use by date? Just do not know because the date was not visible. Poor show!!We thought things would improve at breakfast but as my wife has an intolerance to wheat and is pre diabetic we knew that we would be able to have porridge (enthusiastically advertised in the hotel). Unfortunately, there is a standard price for breakfast, which would have made this as expensive as the porridge at he Savoy. Maybe.What a pity as our West London bolthole will need replaced by another. Rather galling as an Accors member.",21-Oct-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html

I have found this hotel to be up there with the best hotels I have stayed at. The staff were friendly and professional, the rooms were clean.

Visiting this hotel for the second time and definitely good choice.Again excellent staff and room are very clean and tidy.I checked in during busy time but everything was quick and efficient .Following morning I had breakfast with usual continental and cooked which was nice.I will return to my next trip in London.,11-Oct-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"We spent 4 days here during the first part of our anniversary trip. The hotel is in a great location. Just steps away from the Shepherds Bush tube station, which made it incredibly convenient for getting around London. We arrived a couple of hours before official check in time, but they were able to check us in early (which was very appreciated after a long flight). The room was bright and clean, a little small, but we knew to expect that in London. We had ample space for everything and were quite comfortable. After checking in we decided to walk around London (trying to stay awake to adjust to the time change). During our check in chat we happened to mention we were there to celebrate our 30th anniversary, when we returned to our room, later that day, we found heart balloons, rose petals on the bed, champagne flutes, a small bottle of sparkling wine and a very nice card. What a thoughtful gesture.We had a very pleasant stay here and found the staff incredibly friendly, room very nice, clean, bright and comfortable (although the mattress wasn't the most comfortable we had ever slept on). But generally we were really pleased with our stay and enjoyed it very much.",9-Oct-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"The beds are incredibly small. I booked a twin room and the beds were so tiny I almost fell off several times. Like you can't even roll over. That's how tiny they were. There was spare room between the bedside tables and the actual beds. So you could see how a regular single bed could fit in there but instead they put like, I don't know, 70 cm wide beds? The rooms weren't really big either. If there's two of you, which was the case for me, one person had a place to put their suitcase but the other one just had to put it on top of the table. Next to the other person's bed. It just seems poorly planned. But there were many lil empty spots around the room, so we made it work.The staff were lovely though. The people at reception made you feel welcome and the housekeeping staff were super helpful. Thanks a lot.",8-Oct-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html
"We have stayed at this hotel a few times and even though it is not as convenient as other Ibises we have stayed at we have always liked it because of the customer service. The lady at check in was friendly enough and the lady we redeemed our drink vouchers with was nice enough but the rest of the staff did not smile, did not greet you and seemed generally disinterested in anything. Breakfast which was always amazing was disappointing and sad. There was no bacon, no eggs, and the sausages were over cooked and the entire breakfast staff looked haggard and in a daze. The room was fine and the shower was good as always but someone needs to step in and do a little team building with the staff because let's face it, it's all about the customer service.

"Been a regular customer several times until the previous visit which has left a horrible experience from the management team in this hotel.

"Stayed for one night after a conference in Wales before flying back. Chosed by location and accessibility, coming from Paddington. Room was excellent, breakfast acceptable (too crowded and noisy) and food was average. Service is not so good as receptionists also function as cleaning personnel for breakfast and guests pile up to checkin, checkout and ask questions, call a taxi, etc at the booth functioning as reception. Worse is that some receptionists DO NOT KNOW LONDON which is not acceptable. Having no idea about Victoria train station is unbelievable. Taxi company estimate given on the phone of a service to Victoria was 14 pounds, taxi driver wanted 22. the taxi called by the hotel did not have a meter so the driver can squeeze you. so, excellent room, good location but terrible service. You have to know London not to depend on the service the hotel personnel cannot provide...",11-Sep-18, Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3523343-Reviews-Ibis_London_Shepherds_Bush_Hammersmith_Hotel-London_England.html

"Stayed here for just over a week in early August 2018. Would do it again. Good access to public transport, comfortable quiet rooms, and considering London prices, good value for money.

"Set in a Poplar backstreet this is probably the smartest boutique hotel I've stopped in. Got a great deal through their own website and booked for a Friday night with breakfast. On arrival we were greeted by Zuber who made us feel very welcome and gave us all the information we needed. The room itself was amazing with modern one touch light SWITCHES, A modern TV with full Entertainment system and a mobile phone that can be used for free calls and internet inside or outside the hotel. We decided to eat in the restaurant and weren't disappointed. As we were the only ones in there we received great service. The menu offers five or six starters, mains and desserts and our Calamari, Nachos, Fish and Chips and Chicken Burger were all freshly cooked and were clearly not freezer food. The cocktails we had were very strong and reasonably priced. The only minor issue we had was with the breakfast. I booked for pre paid bed and breakfast on the Lansbury website only to be told by Zuber that our booking was shown on his system as room only. After showing him my booking he kindly waived the breakfast charge and assured me it was an IT glitch with their system. Saying that the buffet breakfast was very nice with all the usual items and staff were again very helpful and polite. Don't be put off by the location as you are only five minutes walk to All Saints or Poplar DLR. I will definitely be back.

"The hotel itself was reasonably OK. The room and bed were quite nice. The bathroom was small but the shower worked well. TV was fine.Tea and coffee in the room. However, the window did not open at all so the room got stuffy and airless.The air con was noisy and we couldn't get it to work properly. There was a gym and sauna downstairs. This was supposedly open till 10pm but when I went at 9pm, they had turned it off. There was no apology but they turned it on although it didn't get hot before 10pm. The main start switch on the treadmill in the gym didn't work but someone came and showed me how to get it to work.The breakfast and lunch were fine. Nothing special but quite OK. The restaurant was a bit dark an airless in the basement. The staff were lovely throughout: very friendly and helpful. However, there didn't seem to be any overall manager overseeing things.The hotel was excellent value for London - around £110 including breakfast for 2.The main drawback was the location. It was quite a nice hotel right on the edge of a Tower Hamlets housing estate. There were no restaurants (except fried chicken) and although the DLR was very close, the tube was a 15-20 minute walk navigating a huge road. Uber was at hand and we did get about that way.",23-Jun-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

"I booked to stay hear last minute as we had tickets for a concert at the o2. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised, I normally stay at the rosewood when in London but wanted somewhere a bit closer this time as we didn’t have lots of time for commuting.Direct access routes via the DLR to get to the hotel. The DLR only takes about 10 mins also to get to and from London city airport. Great location for events at the o2 approximately 20 mins via DLR and underground. More importantly about £16 back in a taxi from the o2 to avoid the massive underground queues.The hotel it’s self was immaculate, very clean everywhere. Front of house staff are also very welcoming and helpful.The room itself was very nicely decorated and well equipped, I have spent a lot more money in other hotel and got a fraction of the luxuries and service that we got here.I don’t really have any negative things to say but maybe just a bit of constructive feedback that may be helpful was that my room on the ground floor wasn’t the quietest of rooms. I couldn’t figure out if it was the plumbing above that was very noisy when the toilet or taps were being used. Finally the info booklet informs guests that room service is available to 11pm for some items. I called for room service at 10:40 and was told the kitchen was closed. However I do feel the last point is understandable if it’s been a quiet night for the chef to let them get away.All in all I was very pleased and felt that the hotel was great value and served its purpose well. I wouldn’t hesitate about staying again if I was attending another concert at the o2.",5-Jun-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

We found this hotel as we got last minute tickets to a concert at the o2 and didn't want to have to travel back to Bedford after. We saw reviews stating it was a 'little gem' and couldn't agree more. 15 mins walk from canary wharf tube or 6 pound in an uber it was so easy getting tot the concert. The hotel itself is lovely. Reception where very helpful. Room was clean tidy and well equipped. Even a mobile phone for guests to take and use while staying! The shower was a lively walk in shower and the breakfast was excellent. We are definitely going to stay here again next time we visit the o2. ,18-May-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

"We were attracted to the Lansbury Heritage Hotel by its Victorian architecture and its history. The rooms were beautifully rendered and spacious. The restaurant is the best in the Docklands area that we saw. And the breakfast was probably the best we've ever had traveling in London (over 40 times). We also wanted to see a new part of London we had not seen, and got to know the Docklands Light Railway which became an easy way to get into Victoria and Knightsbridge. Personnel and staff were outstanding and dedicated individuals. We enjoyed the spa with excellent massages to start off our trip. All in all, we would definitely stay again and recommend it highly.",12-May-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

"Had a wonderful stay. The hotel is immaculate very modern and clean state of the art room central controls via the tv We had a girlie birthday weekend and had a ball. Zuber was our outstanding, really friendly helpful reception staff member who was really helpful both before we came and on our stay. We had a superior room. Which is worth paying extra for The spa is compact in a small area and they didn’t seem to be able to fit us in for hour appointments for treatments but there never seemed to be any customers in there having appointments which was puzzling.

"The best hotel in Canary Wharf in London is the Novotel, from all aspects. But the second best is the Lansbury Heritage hotel in Poplar 15 min walking distance from Canary Wharf. The hotel looks like castle and is truly a boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and informed, rooms are amazing: clean, big, with a lot of natural light, high ceilings, everything is digitally controlled, great bathroom. I did not give it a five star rating because the restaurant could be better in terms of non-meat dishes. Anyhow, meal was quite good. Good value for money.

"had 3 days at this hotel in march with friends for a 40th birthday. it was a bit of a struggle to get to on and off 3 tubes for us and a 10 min walk from poplar station but the hotel is gorgeous and smells amazing !!we had a mezzanine room, bathroom downstairs bedroom upstairs. very cool really nice room, amazing shower, terrible views but we didnt choose it for the views. very close to canary wharf ( you must eat at big easy ) wow. the only issues i had were our room was not cleaned one day just towels folded and everything else left as we had left the room also i asked for milk for tea on 4 occasions over 3 days before any arrived..not a huge problem but there seemed to be a disconnect between reception and housekeeping and if tou speak to 4 different receptionists and nothing is done you feel ignored but as i say not a huge issue.yes i would stay here again breakfast was buffet style and fantastic, also breakfast staff were so helpful ( well done guys ) so id say 4 star due to service issues",1-Apr-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

"Hotel is very nice, friendly and helpful staff on arrival. We stayed in room G02 which was lovely and spacious, very modern and comfortable. Breakfast and room service also good. Catered for gluten free no problem at all. 5 min walk to poplar DLR station offering links to Canary Wharf tube. Only downside is to walk to the DLR station, you have to walk through tower hamlets college, which sometimes consisted of groups of mainly male students outside with hoods up and could be quite intimidating to lone females, older people etc. On the whole hotel itself was lovely and would stay again and recommend to people as a great hotel to stay if visiting the 02.

Stayed here one night for a convention at the excel. Fabulous mezzanine room. Staff all very lovely. The tech is all very snazzy but the bathroom light is not on the wall next to the bathroom and there is no way to know which light is the bathroom and which one is the hall. Also the AC was not strong enough to keep us cool overnight.

We would recommend this hotel the decor rooms and service are excellent. Breakfast was a good standard and all guest areas tastefully designed.

"While the hotel is beautifully decorated to a high standard, the food is a real let down. Ordering room service via the in-room smart phone technology did not allow me to order a drink with my meal. The food was very average; calamari was tough and greasy and the chicken burger was missing the homemade coleslaw and was quite tasteless. Again, for breakfast, there was no opportunity to order a drink and the breakfast was delivered with a very creamy cafe latte ( as opposed to the black coffee that I would have ordered).Unfortunately the food really lets the hotel down and means that I would avoid staying here again.",11-Mar-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html
I had booked 2 eating experiences in London and we decided to stay for a couple of days in the city. After a long search we chose the Lansbury hotel. We were not disappointed. We decided to use the underground instead of the car . The Lansbury is approx 5 mins walk from Poplar station and was a perfect base to explore London before our 2 evening meals out. What a lovely hotel. Decor superb and very attentive staff.

"I booked my parents a night here for Christmas. They checked in early, and the was not ready which was fine as they were happy to go for a drink. Reception staff need to improve their manners though a 'good afternoon' would of been nice!Bar staff didn't know what a Southern Comfort was, and a barman couldn't open a drinks cabinet. In the end my mum had to go behind to try and help.Not the fault of staff but management need to provide adequate training.The Octaganal room and spa was lovely! And the food was very nice. On leaving the hotel to go for dinner and 02, my mum was asked for her credit card and because it didn't match the card that it was booked by (I booked it for Christmas for them- all paid for) the lady said she needed my details. My mum explained that I was at work and would not be able to answer the call. The hotel had been all paid for! And card details had all been given.In the end the lady had to transfer the money back to my card for my mum to pay the £173!

My partner and I stayed at this stunning hotel a few weekends ago. The room we stayed in was well presented and detailed. It was beautiful.The only minor downsides we found was that the shower was not as hot as we would have liked and the area was a bit iffy. But other than that it's close to local amenities and the DLR and all staff we interacted with were very pleasant. ,1-Feb-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html
We’ve stayed twice now at this hotel and found it excellent on both occasions. Rooms are luxurious and well thought out. The staff are helpful and professional. We had a problem with the AC (it didn’t want to drop below the boiling point of titanium) which was fixed instantly when we reported it. The photos and bas relief carvings and chandeliers all add a touch of opulence for what is essentially a bargain priceThe only suggestion I’d make to the management would be to buy some teapots for breakfast - we had to make tea in the (small) cups which is quite labour intensive and wastes tea bags. It’s a bit off the beaten path and the walk from Canary Wharf isn’t pleasant but it’s well worth the inconvenience. ,18-Jan-19, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

"Well....... what a spectacular hotel. One of the best hotels in London! I highly recommend this hotel as its location is extremely easy to find ( even if your not from London) it’s short walk from poplar station. The entrance is truly breathtaking, the staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The restaurant is very nice and has a calm atmosphere, they serve food and drinks and until late. The room was very modern, but had sophistication. It’s Extremely clean and well thought out. You can pretty much do everything you need to do from the tv/Remote control. From turning lights on and off to controlling the room temperature. Everything is easily accessible. The room was very spacious and so was the bathroom. It was like being on a luxurious holiday for the day/night. The breakfast was undeniably amazing, everything was fresh and seasoned so well! Fresh orange juice and fruit.There’s plenty of shops and restaurants near by. I would Definitely recommend this hotel whether it’s business or pleasure!

The room contained a TV with the usual channels, and also a free to use mobile that could be taken out whilst staying at the hotel if needed. The room was very quiet at night.

The hotel has a fitness room and sauna included, and a to be paid for spa.The breakfast was very good, both full English as continental style.

I could not fault the room or any of the facilities at this hotel. They were as fantastic as all previous reviews led me to believe. The location is wonderful. Very well connected but a very quiet street. The building is a lovely sensitive conversion of a listed property. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious. The breakfast was very good and plentiful. The only thing I would say is that don’t expect the staff to do anything beyond their minimum obligation. We had booked the hotel for our wedding night as we were getting married in Greenwich and wanted something a little bit special. We always try to support smaller hotels particularly as this one seemed to be of a very high standard. When booking I asked if we could possibly check in any earlier as check in was at 3 and I was getting married at 4 so would need to do so before then. I was sent email by staff telling me they would be able to let me know nearer the time. Perfectly reasonable. I rang the week before to be told it wasn’t possible and I would have to arrive at 3. Too late by this point to book elsewhere. We’ll run with it. I rang on the day and was told my room wouldn’t be ready till 3 but they would happily store bags if I arrived earlier. Would they put them in the room as I wouldn’t be back till gone midnight because of the wedding celebration. They said they would try to do that but couldn’t guarantee it. I arrived at 2 expecting to just drop my bags and was told my room was ready and nobody thought to call me and tell me that. Not once did any member of staff wish me or my new wife congratulations on our marriage despite the fact I hold told them several time the purpose of our stay. For that reason I wouldnt stay again. It was very nice but ultimately staff make a hotel. Not facilities.,25-Nov-18, Lansbury Heritage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12259847-Reviews-Lansbury_Heritage_Hotel-London_England.html

The room was spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated with plenty of handy features that make this a luxury stay. It was very comfortable and fairly quiet considering it's on Poplar High Street. The reception ordered a taxi for me to get me to the event and again the service was amazing, not your average cab and they work exclusively with hotel and business clients. The Breakfast was plentiful with a good variety of choice and served for a good length of time. Standard Check out is 12pm which is longer than most hotels.

"Recently stayed here with my friend for a night as we were going to the theatre. Hotel has a great central location, with plenty of food places surrounding it. It's a couple of minutes walk from the tube line which is ideal when you have luggage. Hotel itself was lovely, rooms were a decent size for central London, reception staff were lovely throughout the stay. We were able to leave suitcases there all day after we checked out which was an added bonus. We had read reviews about the stairs/lack of lift, we stayed on the 3rd floor, but the staircases aren't huge and even with suitcases it was no problem. All in all I think this is a cracking little hotel, perfect for a couple of nights exploring the city, definitely recommend!",22-Feb-19,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Great Location, very discrete but cozy and comfortable. Only a few minutes walk from Earl's Court Stn. Many eating and drinking places around. Friendly staff. Rooms are medium sized but well appointed.

"The London Court Hotel is a quick 2 minute walk from the Earls Court Underground station (exit and go left). The registration process was quick. We booked this hotel for a 3 night stay, then decided to add a day at the beginning of our trip. I contacted the hotel and was about to keep the same room for all 4 nights. The hotel was quick to respond and take action.Upon arrival to our room, we noticed it was clean, modern, looked like the photos, and small (as to be expected). We were assigned room 307. As there is no lift, the climb to the top floor got old very quickly, and I found myself dreading the thought of returning to the room each day. There were coffee and tea making facilities in our room, a hair dryer, 2 USB ports, plenty of channels on the TV, and speedy free Wi-Fi. Some of the negatives: not enough hangers (we did not ask for additional); tiny waste bins; and the safe was locked (again, we did not request it be opened). There were no drawers for clothes storage, so I left my suitcase open and slid it under the bed to conserve space.Earls Court Road in that area is full of restaurants. There's a Nando's, McDonald's, Izzi (Italian), Prince of teck (pub), Pret, and Co Op (market) all on the short walk from the tube station. We also walked beyond the hotel to have dinner at The Hansom Crab (pub) for fish and chips.All in all, the hotel was a fantastic value, and I would love to stay there again.",12-Feb-19,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. It was very nice! The room wasn't big, but its size was more than acceptable by London standard. Most importantly, though, it was very clean (I'm asthmatic and I had no problem at all with this hotel). The staff was cordial and pleasant to deal with. There was only one small issue: the stairs. There is no lift and the stairs are quite cramped, so don't bring heavy luggage :-P",19-Jan-19,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
A good choice if you're after the location and convenience. The only setback I can think of is the elevator. Its very small. But everything was great especially the girl who serves us well every morning.

"Clean, friendly, relatively easy to find and quiet given it's right on the main road at Earls Court. Only thing I'd improve is a slightly comfier bed but if you like beds hard, you'll love this place.

no iron in room was disappointing.Good windows kept out 90% of street noise. Creaks from movement in room above was annoying when sleeping.staff were very nice and rooms were clean.

"I chose this hotel for the location and the price. It is right by the Earls Court stop on the tube making it a short (30 minute) trip to Heathrow and I was planning to head to the airport in the morning. As most things in London can be quite pricey, the cost of the room was about 100 GBP per night. Though the staff was friendly, the room itself can use some improvement. The carpets were stained, one of the sheets on the bed had dried blood (we called downstairs for a replacement), and found a dead roach under the alarm clock. Positives about the room -- nice bathroom and free bottled water.",14-Oct-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"The pros: located at less than 100 mt from Earl Court Tube Station, very nice reception staff, clean, functional, modern deco, good bathroom.The cons: minimalist hotel (reception in first floor, narrow stairs, no elevator), with tiny rooms.

"I stayed here a couple of nights for business. The price is competitive and for the most part the room was clean although the carpets could have been better and had a number of stains. The main issue I had was from traffic noise. I'm an incredibly heavy sleeper and am not usually bothered by noise, but even I was woken up at 4am and I know my wife would have struggled to sleep at all.On the positive side it is in a good location close to restaurants, cafes and the tube station to take you into the heart of London in only a few minutes.",23-Sep-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Yes, this hotel is great for its location being very close to a Tube station, but that's about it. There's no elevator. I came with three suitcases and had to haul them up a flight of stairs just to get to the reception desk, where the receptionist offered to carry one up to the third floor of our room. No outside calls are permitted on the room phones. The safes are only large enough to store jewelry. This is inconvenient when traveling with laptops and such. My only option was to pack electronics and valuables in a suitcase and leave it in the reception area in plain view near the place guests can help themselves to coffee. I was assured it was perfectly safe there. It was either that or leave it in my room. So, each night, after walking and sight seeing all day, I would have to come back to the hotel and carry the heavy suitcase back to my room. No breakfast, bar, laundry services. I would not stay here again.",9-Aug-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Stayed for 5 nights in June. The hotel is in a great location – Earls Court is easily accessible by the underground, and there are great cafes, restaurants and supermarkets just outside the hotel. The room was a good size for a 'single room' – the bathroom wasn’t crowded, and there was enough space for my luggage. It was clean and modern, although the bed sheets felt a little old. There’s no lift but the staff will help you with your luggage. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.",1-Jul-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"We recently stayed for 4 nights. The rooms are small but have everything you need. Just note there is no lift so had to carry our suitcases up and down the stairs. The location is great, just outside of the London city, with the underground a 1 minute walk. The lines on the Earls Court underground take you straight to the city Centre or airport so that is a big plus. The street the hotel is on is full of restaurants, pubs etc so no shortage of food options.",26-Jun-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"This is a boutique hotel located right by the Earl's Court Metro station in London. The hotel is fine and offers clean room and comfortable bed.

"In a good location, close to Earls Court station and we really walked almost everywhere; Royal Albert Hall, museum of Natural History etc. Lots of good food nearby. Not too noisy due to the small street, but not much more to stop noise from other rooms or the street. I guess that is the case in most London hotel. Recommend for young people, due to the fact that you have to climb up a narrow and steep staircase to get to the hotel. The hotel door might be hard to spot! Passed it once, cos its really just a tiny door in the middle of store windows.Was very sufficient for a long weekend!",9-Apr-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Everything you need. Clean hotel with two minutes walk to tube, which takes you to most important places. Comfy bed to sleep after long day walking around city. Best of all enough plugs to charge eg. phones beside your bed. Even one USB. Good shower. I can recommend.Downsides:Very tiny room, but we of course knew it and saw pictures before hand. Enough for two persons with small lagguages. Anyhow it was priceworthy.But: No instruction for safety, like you have to reset the earlier code (never in another hotel before) and how to lock and open it.For to use hairdrier like press the button in the mirror.Piece of information would be nice in the room or personnel could advice when you check in.

"I have to admit that when I first found The London Court House on a booking website I was initially suspicious. The score was unusually high in terms of satisfaction and value for money, and yet the price per night - despite the additional factors of central location, close proximity to a tube station, and amenities in the room itself - was relatively low. Having been burnt before at other 'hotels,' I did my best to uncover the catch with no luck so I booked a room and crossed my fingers.When I arrived, I was more than pleasantly surprised and a little relieved. The only thing I could find to detract from the place was the stairs, which could have been an issue for older or impaired guests. There are no lifts and to reach the lobby or any guest rooms you have to climb a couple of flights of stairs. I arrived with several heavy bags, which the hotel staff kindly helped me with upon arriving and departing. In fact, the staff were wonderful and couldn't seem to do enough for me during my stay. They were endlessly friendly and pleasant, greeting me during my frequent comings and goings.The gentleman working on reception when I arrived kindly stored my bags in the reception until I could check in to allow me to explore London, then helped me to carry them to my room upon my return. The room itself was unusual but very comfortable. There were stairs from the doorway down to the room itself, which featured every expected amenity. There was a single (very comfortable!) bed, a television on the opposite wall, a small desk and chair, a wardrobe, small safe, a small fridge, a kettle and a good supply of tea and coffee. There was even a complimentary bottle of still water in the fridge every day once the room had been serviced. The bathroom was very modern and clean.I stayed for a total of three nights, and couldn't fault my stay! The location was very useful for comings and goings, there was no noise to speak of from other rooms or outside, the wi-fi was reliable and the staff, as I stated, were excellent. I would highly recommend this hidden gem and wouldn't hesitate to book with them again. Thank you for an enjoyable stay!",26-Feb-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"We loved this hotel and stayed there three nights. It was about 30 seconds walk from the Earls court tube station. Look left coming out the station and you'll see it. The rooms are small but really nicely decorated with great air conditioning/heating unit, safe, fridge, lovely bathroom and are absolutely spotless. Free bottles of water are provided everyday and there is free tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms and there is a nice coffee machine in reception which can be used any time. Yes it is up a good few steep stairs and obviously wouldn't suit anyone with mobility issues but otherwise, it's not a problem in that you're only bringing your cases up and down once and other than that would only go up and down them once or twice a day. But it actually makes it quieter as you're up off the main street, so it's not a bad thing! It doesn't have a bar or restaurant, it's only bedrooms but in London with so many places to eat, we wouldn't want to eat where we are staying anyway. The lady who did the cleaning was really nice and did a very good job but special mention has to go to the two gentlemen on reception. They were so nice and helpful and couldn't have done more. We used to get a little wave every time we passed reception. It really made us feel at home! They really are a great asset to the hotel. We will definitely stay there next time we're in London.",20-Jan-18,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html

"Great hotel with one big exception - no hot water in the shower due to a problem with the boiler. Staff would not compensate us for no hot water except to say that we could get a discount on our next stay there. We explained that we will not be returning to London. It was unfortunate, because the hotel is quite nice, everything looked new and it was easy access to the tube and restaurants.

"London Court Hotel is located a mere 1 minute's walk from Earl's Court station - wonderful location. The station itself hosts both the Piccadilly and District lines, which are already sufficient for getting to most places. When exiting the station, head left and you'll pass Co-op, Nando's and Costa before arriving at the hotel. The hotel entrance is easy to miss since there is no frontage beyond a single door. If you see Starbucks, you've missed it and should double back.A word of caution though, the hotel has no lifts and you'll need to drag your luggage up several flights of stairs. This should not be a problem for most, but is still good to know in advance.The room was very comfortable and there was generally ample room. The bathroom was reasonably sized as well. The only drawback to this hotel was the poor condition of the beds; they were far too soft.All things considered, an excellent choice if you just need a convenient place to base yourself for exploring London.

"Two of us stayed here over the bank holiday weekend for SW4 and carnival. The location was superb, right by Earls court station. There are a number of places to eat and drink around the hotel as well as local supermarkets. The two pubs we went to near by were friendly and had great service. The gentlemen of reception was incredibly welcoming. I asked via email if we could check in early as we had to change before SW4, and he got the room ready early for us at no extra cost. A fancy room at a reasonable price. Much fancier than any other room I've stayed in in London for the same price. Two things to note - lots of stairs and no lift, so it is not suitable for people who can't access stairs. Also, the bar is alcohol free (but the pub over the road is neat)",12-Sep-17,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html

Discreet hotel sign, just look for the Costa Coffee, the door is next to it. William was able to check us in early, so helpful and able to answer all our questions. Had read the reviews about no elevator, requested and received a lower floor. The deluxe twin room was larger than I had expected for London and worked perfectly for our needs.

"This is by far one of the best value oriented places to stay in London. Located within a block of Earls Court station next door to a Nandos and a short walk to a 24 hour Tesco. Even closer is the M&S and a Coop grocery market.The rooms are small (I stayed in the single) and very clean. Windows are well insulated from the street noise. There is a kettle, safe, iron and hairdryer and reliable wi-fi. Front staff is very helpful and are willing to help haul luggage up from street level to your room. Why? I will talk about accessibility next.This establishment has no guest elevators and is not meant for families with strollers (unless you collapse it at the front door and carry it up along with the kid) or guests with physical disability as it is a stairmasters routine to maneuver around. I had a full size suitcase and needed the man at the front desk to haul it down 3 flights of stairs so that I don't pull a muscle or injure myself. I look forward to my next stay here.

There is a full length mirror, some clothes hanging space, a safe and a fridge. The shared bathroom is only a few steps away and it has everything you need. I think is only shared with one other guest. The neighbourhood is lively, with lots of shops and cafes and the subway is a few metres away.

"We stayed here for 3 nights in May. It's in a very convenient location when arriving from Gatwick. We picked up a visitor Oyster card at Gatwick and then hopped on a Southern train into Victoria Station and then transferred to the tube to Earl's Court. Earl's Court is Zone 1/2 so if you're heading into central London, you only get charged for 1 zone. The reception at the hotel helped us carry our luggage up and were very pleasant throughout our stay. We did not mind that they did not have a lift as we did not have heavy bags. We had pizza at Franco Manca (4/5), burgers at Gourmet Burger (5/5) and Thai at Addie's (3.5/5). There's good coffee at Over Under Coffee.

"My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay I this fantastic hotel. At less than a 2 minute walk from Earl's Court station, the location in fabulous. Earl's Court road has all of the eating options , with convenience stores in abundance right outside the hotel. The hotel itself is a little missable from the road, with no frontage as such as the reception is not at ground level. Nothing that a quick look online wouldn't solve. Up a flight of stairs to be greeted by the very friendly reception guy who checked us in, welcoming us to tea, coffee and complementary water. We had booked a twin room as the location was perfect and it was all they had and I can honestly say, contrary to the reviews I read beforehand, the room had ample space for the two of us. Extremely clean bedroom and beautiful bathroom with hair and body wash included and refilled every day. Beds were very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Rooms had always been cleaned once we had returned from a day of sightseeing.Tea and coffee making facilities in the room also as well as at reception. Water was provided in the mini fridge in the room. iPod dock was a bonus and good size tv with lots of channels. Yes the hotel doesn't have lifts but it really wasn't an issue for us with it only being 3 floors!All in all, fantastic and very clean hotel in a great location with friendly staff who always greeted us with a smile. I will recommend to everyone!",15-Feb-17,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"This is a nice hotel, located right next to the Earls Court tube station, with clean modern rooms. rooms are not very big, but are comfortable and the bathrooms are new with good water pressure. Better than most other hotels of similar range in the area, only drawback no elevator, so if you have a lot of luggage probably not the best choice, The doorway is small and you might almost miss it on the street, and need to walk up a flight of stairts to get to reception.",27-Jan-17,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Good price, clean and tidy.Very nice and secure area. Internet is not too fast.The staff very polite and helpful.Breakfast: nothing special but OK. Our room was very nice, clean and bright. The elevator a bit slowly and working in a ""collected style"", stop every floor automatically. Tube station (Earl's Court) and shoping opportunities are also very close.",3-Jan-17,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Arrived there at about 8 PM after a 17 hours flight to London. Love the location of the hotel, you can see many coffee shops and restaurant surrounding the hotel, Nando's, local burgers, starbucks, also some pubs at the corner. Almost everything opens until pretty late, so it was good for our hungry tummy after a long flight.But for some reason, might have missed the details about the hotel when i read the review. Once we enter the hotel we were pretty surprised that there was no lift, while the 2 of us were bringing 3 baggages (due to last minutes packing, we just chuck everything we had for winter) haha anyway the receptionist is located on the 1st floor, very kind guy saying that he will bring all of our baggage up, still we feel bad so we also carry the bags up.After registration and all, we finally get our room.. on the 3rd floor. We didnt think that we have more energy to go all the way up to the 3rd floor with all of the bags. So we decided to leave the big bags at the reception and take whatever we need to the room. Coffee machine is located at the receptionist and its open 24 hours a day. The room is nice, nice comfy double bed and proper bath room, overlooking the pretty busy earls court rd since it was saturday night. Another + point is that its located 3 mins away from the tube. Which makes it easy for you to go anywhere. Overall, Superb location, nice hotel and service..too bad it doesnt have lift and also rather expensive on the night that we booked.",19-Dec-16,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Great location with the tube in walking distance, quite a few restaurants around, and a coffee shop right next door (although they do offer free coffee themselves). The staff was very helpful.The room was small, but cozy. I didn't feel cramped. The bathroom was a good size as well. Everything looked new and clean. Wi-fi was good and no noise issues. I was very satisfied with my experience and would definitely book again.",7-Dec-16,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Firstly it is what it is. It's a cheap, no frills hotel in a decent neighbourhood in the centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world, so you set your expectations accordingly.I needed a one night stay for a business trip knowing I'd get in there early evening and be gone by early morning and for £68 it did the job.I booked a single room with shared bathroom so was a bit apprehensive about what to expect but the room was adequate, it was at the back of the hotel so no road noise and the bathroom was up a couple of flights of short steps, taking me about five seconds to get there so it wasn't an issue. The shared bathroom is key controlled so it's not as if everyone could use it and you shared it with one other single room user. Lots of places to eat right outside the hotel, some nice pubs over the road and the tube stop was about 30 yards away. Only negative was the carpet was a bit grubby and had seen better days so I didn't take my socks off but for the money it did the job and I'd use it again if I needed a short stay.",5-Dec-16,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"We were given a anniversary gift for Cinema night with glass of Champagne, through the Virgin Experience. Went there last night (26/11/16) to see The Apartment.

"Three days business trip was quite started nicely when the room was given me three hours early so I could iron my shirt before meeting. Everything was in excellent condition and even though the room size was very Londonish it was more than ok.

"London Court Hotel is a boutique hotel situated in the heart of Earls Court. This is the best hotel I have stay in London and probably newly build. It is conveniently located just 2-3 minutes walk from the Earls Court tube station in Zone 1 London and near restaurants (kebabs, Nandos, wagamama, masala zone, Mc Donald's, Burger King, KFC, Subway, Chinese, Thai and Indian Food etc) even the supermarkets and Boots and just minutes walk away. When coming from the airport, it's the first stop in London Zone 1 (Earls Court Tube Station - and it's the station with a lift so you don't have to carry your bags through massive flight of stairs ) Earls Court is a convenient location in London and accessible to all major tourist attractions nAside from the perfect location, they have the most hospitable staff. Thumbs up to both Ali and William!! (A job well done, you make my stay a memorable one) I was totally smitten by their warm welcome (early check in/assistance with my luggage to the room) and their assistance throughout my trip. You would notice that the staff in the hotel are genuine people rather than putting up a front and they would go out of the way to assist you . Being a frequent traveller to London and staying in Earls Court area most of the time, you will never get such service or even such good/clean room in other hotels around the area. (Some hotels around that area even charge you £5 pounds just to keep your luggage ) Hence their great reviews. I have listed out the points, hope this helps you :) 1. My room was well lit and the place was properly used. Toilet Amenities was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There is also an air condition in the room, so you would not feel stuffy. 2. The place looks and smells cozy!! Like your home. 3. The staff are well trained (even the Housekeeping staff are extremely professional, polite and do a great job to make your stay even more comfortable - having your free bottles of water in the fridge. 4. There is complimentary coffee and tea daily in your room as well as great cappuccino and other coffees complimentary at the reception. 5. The wifi is free and it's strong, it doesn't disconnect and you could easily use if even for Netflix and YouTube in the evening.6. The have cable TV in the room with all channels, and after a Long day in London.. You will be able to just lay on bed and be spoil for choice . Will Definitely be back Again !!!! Thanks for such a wonderful stay. ",16-Sep-16,Brit Hotels London Court,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d282813-Reviews-Brit_Hotels_London_Court-London_England.html
"Not really knowing what to expect with the prices being so low compared to hotels in London we arrived at the main guest house and it was explained their business is spread between multiple buildings in the road. We were shown to our building just a few minutes walk away, the outside looked a bit grim and old, once we were inside we were pleasantly surprised with our room. Really high spec bath room and quite spacious room. Plenty of storage for clothes and the thing all three of us quickly pointed out was not only was it clean but immaculate! It looked quite recently decorated. We had tea/coffee making supplies along with a hairdryer. We had to go back to the main house for breakfast which had a decent selection of food to choose from. I was really impressed with this place and if I was going to London again I would check the availability here first over a hotel.",3-Jul-19,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"This is a bunch of old 2 story cottages with a single reception and dining room, so take into consideration in bad weather. The room and shower are clean but the entrance corridor is shabby and smells of damp. The doors slam loudly and you can hear the ceiling squeeking when upstairs lodgers walk.We forgot electricity adaptor and reception suggested to sell one for 4 pounds. Same for body soap - propised to sell us!! Even had the nerve to say that we should be grateful for the towels!!Breakfast waitresses were very attentive and pleasant.Close to public transportation, however mind the noise of trains passing!Over 100 pounds a night is excessive for this place!!",27-Jun-19,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"I'm a seasoned traveller and what an absolute gem of a place to find. For the price available, for the location, for the service, the staff, the cleanliness............totally fabulous and makes it possible for me to travel frequently to my beloved London. The location is just amazing and vibrant, very cosmopolitan, and you can get to any part of london from here. I just would not consider staying anywhere else, and I am so delighted to have found the Charlotte Guest House.

"I deliberately chose to stay in a more residential area outside of central London. Decent transport options. Pretty easy from the airport on the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines (although steps at West Hampstead station) and easy to get to Hampstead Heath. As well as the tube, there are also buses that head into the touristy central London area via Abbey Road which is a scenic trip. There's a Tesco nearby on the main street.The house is actually several managed properties spread out on several streets. Stayed in a single room in a building down the street from the main house. Had kettle/tea/coffee, hairdryer and TV although no bodywash/shampoo/conditioner (luckily I always bring my own). There was also no in-room safe, and my room was in the basement level which was a bit unsettling when I first saw it. The stairs down were pitch black at first until I realised the light automatically turns on when you head down the stairs. The room had a window that faced the next-door building under construction. Small, as are most places in the UK, and was a bit old and had dated furniture. But fairly clean and was comfortable. Selection of hot food and cereals at breakfast which was in a nice (but extremely warm) breakfast room. Never had a problem getting a seat. WiFi worked fine.5GBP deposit when checking in which you get back when you return the key. Friendly service. Overall this was a decent stay for two nights and good value for money.",6-Jun-19,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"When we arrived at the guest house, it was as we expected from the picture. However after checking in we were marched back out the front door, down the road, across the road and up another road to another property which apparently they own too. Then we were told they had approximately 5 properties in the area.When they showed us to our room ours was on the ground floor whereas out daughter was put on the top floor, three floors up. Our room was clean and had a new bathroom, but unfortunately is was very poorly lit, there was no dressing table or hair dryer, but most of all the furniture and bedding although they were clean, they were very old and outdated. When we looked outside out window all we saw was a brick wall, which was the side passage!When we checked our daughter's room, although it was brighter, it was like going back to the 50's and that is how old the furniture was and the bathroom was awfully worn out, having to prop the shower head against the wall to even have a shower.We also had a very noisy evening with other guests going in and out of their rooms all night long, and to finish off having to walk two streets with our bags to go and have our breakfast and then check out, which is not what we had expected at all!! (Overall we did not actually stay at the Charlotte Guest House as advertised, but some house down the road).",15-May-19,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"All of the rooms are clean, so that's good. Some of the rooms are also very nice, which is even better. On the other hand, some of the rooms are terrible, and I can tell you at least ONE of the rooms has NO WINDOW (which I thought was against the law)!!! I'm gullible enough to have been coming here for seven years, but I don't feel I can carry on taking the risk of getting a horrible room and a totally shameless response from stroppy desk staff with bad attitudes. All they actually care about is your money. They don't care about breaking promises. They don't care about messing you around. They don't care about ruining your holiday. Basically they don't care. The rooms are clean, but after that I'm struggling to think of reasons to give these people my money ever again. They don't care (except they do care about taking your money).",11-Apr-19,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
Had the pleasure of staying in this little gem last May. Our room were spotless and big and the service was outstanding.

I've stayed in the same building both times but in different rooms with shared bathroom. There isn't a lift and I was on the 2nd floor so I wouldn't recommend staying here if you have mobility issues. The rooms and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and I didn't need to queue for the bathroom at all. They don't provide shampoo/soap for the shower but are available in reception for purchase. There was a good selection for breakfast and they provided a good sized portion. It's close to the tube and in a beautiful neighborhood.

"The rooms were spacious, clean, comfortable. But we were dropped off at reception, and the rooms were in a house 2-1/2 blocks away, across a busy street. And once we got there, we had to lug our bags up 5 flights of stairs. My parents who were traveling with us are in their late 70s and early 80s, one with a recent hip replacement, the other with shoulder issues. The other two of us aren't young either. Breakfast was in the building with reception. And a few days there were waits to get seating for breakfast. Most mornings, we either waited for seats or were guilted into hurrying our breakfast to make room for others.But we got extra towels when we asked and the rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. The ladies at reception connected us to a car service for rides from and to the airport.",25-Oct-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"We stayed here for one night in September, chosen based on the reviews here and its price, not for the location.It's unusual in that there are several buildings in the area that are used, but with breakfast in the main building, but only a couple of minutes away. We were in Lymington which is over a relatively busy road (in the morning at least).The room was large but shared a bathroom with several other rooms so access was a problem in the morning when people were having showers.The breakfast was OK, what you'd expect in a guesthouse anywhere in the UK.Note that check-in is only until 10pm.Overall it was good value for London.",24-Oct-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

"This guest house won't knock you over with it's superficial appearance but the room was spacious and clean. The bathroom is very modern and appears to have been done over in the not too distant past. The highlight of the place is the staff. Dipack, the manager, bent over backwards to address any of our concerns. Anna, our primary server and breakfast and cleaner of our room was also outstanding. The people at the desk and kitchen all seemed to be determined to make you happy. The area had many decent restaurants and it was a short walk to the Jubilee line on the tube.

"We really liked our stay here. The room was cute, the service was great, and the breakfast was also really good.PROS: If you're wanting to be in the West Hampstead area, this is a great location with lots of good restaurants around. Really friendly staff. The breakfast was great, but the fruit juices were gross and kept at room temperature. Comfy accommodations and really reasonable rates.CONS: We arrived after checkin time, but our room still wasn't ready. That was frustrating as we'd had a really long day and really long flight. We had to walk around the neighborhood for a couple hours. Also, it was 85 degrees in the summer and the room was very hot - not really the guest house's problem but it was hard to sleep.Overall, I'd still recommend staying here (in the winter!) and it was a great, inexpensive experience.",7-Aug-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

I took my flipflops with me because I knew I had to share a bathroom with some other people. But the bathroom was so clean, I didn’t even use them. All the people there are so kind and if you need something extra you just have to ask them and they fix it for you. The breakfast was really good and it was a menu with much variety.

"Had a fantastic couple of nights at this charming B&B in a quiet road just off the main street in West Hampstead. Reason for giving 4 stars instead of five -Lighting in the room wasn't great (putting on make-up was very difficult!) Maybe put a brighter light over the dressing table and/or in the bathroom. The door just outside our bedroom had a very strong spring, and so was a bit noisy as it slams every time anyone went through it.Major plus points - The location is very good, a few minutes from the tube and overground. Staff helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, all very clean. We had a good breakfast, coffee refills and nobody rushed us out so it was very relaxing. Most of the guests had been to see Ed Sheeran at Wembley, so having breakfast in the garden the next day with everyone chatting about their experience was really lovely! I would definitely book again for the next time we do a London trip - thank you Charlotte Guest House, we loved staying with you!",17-Jun-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"Family journey (2 adults + 2 children).Excellent stayKind and attentive staff!The breakfast is very good and served promptly (despite the fact that the Guest House was overcrowded).The only very small drawbacks: a Wi-Fi a bit weak and the bedding is good, but nothing more. (Some would add: lots of French persons know the address... ;-D )West Hampstead is a very pleasant and living area, with lots of restaurants.Tube, Overground and railway station permit a quick access to the very heart of LDN, but also attractions located around (Camden Market, WB Studio...)The staff proposes also cheap taxi services, notably to go to the airport.Definitely recommended!!!",22-May-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"I came here last year on my first trip to London. The room isn’t anything to rant about but the room and bathroom were very clean. It was small (I’m ok with tiny spaces) but both buildings felt close and I’m not sure how to explain the whole place was very comfortable. What really made it special is the service. The front desk attendants are amazingly sweet, and very helpful when getting around I would talk to them and they always treated me like I wasn’t bugging them at all! Always extremely welcoming. Next was the food. I cannot explain how much I love the food. I go down and the dining area was almost always full because they didn’t just offer cereal and juice, they gave you meats and eggs and more! I chose this place because it was inexpensive and ended up being very happy! The cost was less than an overnight stay in any hotel in America with better food and service. I will be visiting again when I can because I miss it!",20-May-18,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

The room was on the ground floor, clean, nice size ( with a double and single bed) and a lovely little en-suite. We were going to the theatre later that day and the taxi was arranged by the lady on reception, the same company picked us up and took us back to the guest house. On Sunday we went to breakfast which was in the main building opposite, the breakfast area was very busy and a little cramped but again the staff were friendly and cheerful. The cooked breakfast was really nice and plentiful, I would definitely stay here again, its very good value for money, the staff are friendly and helpful and rooms are a good size and clean.

"Stayed here on a three night break to London, and found the accommodation to be homely and comfortable. The breakfast also fantastic with a great range of things to choose from to start your day. A fantastic location, too: a few minutes walk to the tube station, and plenty of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. I'd highly recommended the Railway Pub, which is around 5 minutes walk away. Excellent food and ales, and music fans may be interested to know that Cream, Hendrix and the Stones all played there.",7-Dec-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"I was in London on my own for one night and so I wasn't too particular as regards accommodation - all I needed was somewhere to sleep that was convenient to the centre and good value. What could I expect for £57? Not much, I thought. I was pleasantly surprised.I was assigned Room A at 165 Sumatra Road (a few hundred yards away from the main house - the nice girl at reception walked with me there and made sure I knew the layout). As expected (and as indicated when booking) it was small but perfectly adequate. It was a cold night in London but the room was nice and warm.The bed was comfortable, the room was spotlessly clean and the en-suite shower/toilet very convenient (some other rooms have shared bathroom facilities). Noise-wise, the rumble of trains from the nearby station was obvious until about 11pm or so but thereafter, until 6:30am, it was silence. Neither could I hear any of my neighbours or traffic ( the house is on a quiet road). It made for a perfect night's sleep.Breakfast was at the main house and there was a good choice - Full English, scrambled or poached eggs, or Continental plus the usual juices and cereals. All the hot food was freshly made to order. My scrambled eggs and coffee were perfect.All in all, ideal accommodation for the budget-conscious traveler and it will be my first choice for my occasional visits to London from now on. The area is safe and there are good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity (I recommend the Railway Bar which has excellent food). West Hampstead Tube Station is only a few minutes walk away and so very convenient for getting into town.",22-Nov-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"4 days in London in a beautiful location, near underground, overground, thameslink and bus going to the city center. Good quality/price ratio.

"I did't realise the rooms are across different buildings when I booked the hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised as my room was big with a comfy bed and excellent shower. The staff is friendly, ready to give information and help with all queries we had. Overall good value for its price and the breakfast was tasty and various. Would definitely recommend.",3-Nov-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"This property is unique. Basically two old Victorian terraces made into a hotel. Note what I’ve said there. They haven’t knocked through they give you a key and you can be asked to leave and go next door. Odd.The hotel is off the main area for trendy bars and near the tube line so location is good. The area can be a little imposing at night. Remember you are surrounded by faceless predominantly bed sits and flats. The street isn’t particularly clean.So our visit started off meeting the receptionist who was professional and polite. She got us a cab sorted.We had to leave the reception out of the door and into next door. The stairs had stairs going down to a very dingy looking basement flat area not very inviting. We were first floor. The hotel seems like beds it land I guess it probably was. We laughed when we opened the door. It was like being transported back in time. 1960-70 era furniture. Yes it was clean but not exactly modern. The bed felt soft. Compact and bijou is the ideal terminology.The TV is minuscule more like a computer monitor high up on the wall. Worked ok but for this age poor. Wi if was acceptable.The bathroom was very modern and of a good standard although there was an odd smell. There is no shower gel provided and two thin towels. I noted that the outside of the basin had toothpaste residue on it. Two beakers were provided.We went out most of the night. You are given two keys, one for the front door. It was quiet when we returned at midnight.We had a terrible nights sleep. The mattress is sub standard. I literally was touching the bed frame when lying down. We missed the sign saying we could ask for extra pillows. Boy did we need them. We ended up using two lumpy decorative pillows as well as the well used ones provided. We were constantly waking up in agony. We both have low back pain today. This is not the place for a romantic interlude. We both said a park bench would’ve given us a better sleep.Noise from the underground is minimal.This is written pre breakfast. Why ? Because I can’t get back to sleep. And on the day when the clocks went back, another hour in here. The bedroom was warm, there are tea and coffee making facilities.Overall impression. If you are on a budget use it. No more than a night. If not don’t buy the last round upgrade somewhere else. Lastly if booking with booking dot com book and then check prices a few days before coming. We did this cancelled and rebooked saving £16. ",29-Oct-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"Great location, only a 5 minute walk from under and overground transport. Cute little townhouses, divided into multiple rooms. We stayed in a private bathroom suite, which was small (room for a bed, dresser, and shower/toilet), but it was all that we needed. We were gone during the day, and just needed a bed to sleep in at night. The buildings are old, and have thin walls, but they are charming. The breakfasts were delicious! And the wait staff were kind and helpful. I would recommend if staying .",26-Oct-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

"Stayed here for 6 consecutive nights in a double room, shared bath. It was nice and quiet. The incuded breakfast was amazing and the staff and service was great. It is conveniently located near a main street and a short walk away from public transportation. The only thing that could have been better was the bed, it was uneven.",24-Sep-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"Charlotte Guest House, is an ideal location for short stays in London. I regularly visit during the week when I'm in the city for work, and am yet to have a bad experience. Situated on Sumatra Road in the affluent area of West Hampstead, it is only a short walking distance away from an array of bars and restaurants, as well as West Hampstead Underground, Overground, and Thameslink stations. There are also frequent bus services from the adjoining B510 road. This renders it a great location for travelling to virtually any part of London. The rooms are basic, but well maintained and clean. All benefit from a TV, tea/coffee making facilities, wash hand basin, and either an ensuite or shared bathroom. Rooms with the latter can be as cheap as £43, so if you're looking to save money on your trip and have no problem sharing, this would be ideal as you're not likely to find anywhere else this good, for this price in London. All guests benefit from a complimentary breakfast, served in the dining area next to the reception. A decent selection of food and drink is available, and is served by polite and diligent staff, who work very hard to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's easy to make a reservation on their website; so if you're planning a trip to London, I'd strongly recommend you consider this place.

"On arrival reception staff very welcoming. Stayed for two nights, had a single room small but very clean, shared a bathroom which where very modern and spotless clean. Breakfast took place in the main house across the road, a good selection on the menu (full English, Continental etc) which is included in the price. Great value for money. All the staff where friendly and helpful. Round the corner from the station. Plenty of eateries on the main street in fact there is everything you need within a few minutes walk. Certainly would go there again.",10-Sep-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"I stayed here five nights and got an amazing deal on the room. The location was perfect – West Hempstead – a few blocks walk to the Underground, Overground, and Thameslink. There are great bus services nearby but I didn’t use them as the trains were sufficient. There’s a Laundromat a few blocks away on the high street should you need to do laundry. Reception was super friendly and accommodating. My room was cozy and clean, with a kettle, a television, and a sink. I booked the single, so it was a twin bed, and although the room was on the small side, I didn’t feel cramped. I was on the top floor, which wasn’t a problem either, but since there’s no elevator, if you cannot do stairs I would speak with the hotel beforehand to see if you can be placed on a lower floor. I had no issues with the Wi-Fi, nor with the television in the room. The bathrooms are shared and they are kept clean, but bring your own toiletries. I don’t know why others are complaining on here about the key deposit, but yeah, you have to leave a £5 deposit, which isn’t the worst thing in the world and you get it back at the end of your stay, but I digress. I stayed in one of the houses directly across the street from reception. Just so you know, Charlotte Guest House is more of a B&B type of establishment and is made up of several houses on the street. You’ll breakfast in the main reception house. The breakfast was perfect, with many hot and cold choices on offer. The breakfast room is small so it gets crowded and can be chaotic, but that is to be expected when you're all clamoring to eat at the same time in the morning. London is so expensive, but Charlotte Guest House was an excellent value for the money.",29-Aug-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"Stayed there with my 11 year old son. Super nice staff. A clean room, reasonable size, nice recently renovated bathroom. Wifi, good tv. Safe neighborhood. I liked the made to order breakfast in the conservatory. An as-advertised pleasant simple guest house. Restaurants, bars, cafes, grocery stores, everything... plus train, tube, and bus, just around the corner. What more could you ask for at this price? The only minus might be the mattress (a bit worn), but I slept fine despite that. Pleasantly surprised that the nearby rail did not disturb our sleep at all.",20-Aug-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html
"We spent three days at the Charlotte Guest House. The property is spread over a number of adjacent buildings so we had to walk along Sumatra Road to the main premises for breakfast. Breakfast was ok but not memorable. Dining room felt cramped.Anna was helpful on our arrival and made us welcome. Our room up a steep flight of stairs was fairly compact with our two suitcases. However, the room and the small bathroom were clean. The room was serviced daily to a good standard.For us the room was just somewhere to sleep as we spent most of our time out and about. It wasn't a place I wanted to linger in during the day.The property is handy to underground stations and there are a number of eating places in the neighbourhood as well as a couple of handy supermarkets.Overall, the Charlotte isnt a top of the range property and what you get is a reflection of the price you pay in the London market.",4-Aug-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

(no offence to the Ritz, it's a very nice tea...)High points... very comfortable bed, excellent choice for breakfast... all made to order and great staff.For the price no real bad points... could have done with a sheet as it was a little warm for the duvet, but I have no doubt that if I asked I would have got one... fatigue took over... very comfortable bed..!!!We will definitely stay again when we have our next break in town....",22-Jul-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

"This was a great B&B in London. The reception staff were lovely and friendly, check in was easy, the room was in the house next door to the one with the reception and the breakfast area, but it was fine staying there. The room itself was a good size and was clean and the en suite seemed pretty new and was really clean! The only slight drawback to it was that you could hear the noise of the trains going by. If you're a light sleeper this place mightn't suit you, otherwise I'd say to definitely stay here!The area was also good - the B&B was located near to a number of shops and also to the underground, overground, multiple bus routes and to a train line!Oh one other little thing, left luggage is just in reception, mine was fine when I stayed there, but not everyone might be fond of this.Would I stay there again? Yes, I've even been looking up when I can :)",29-May-17,Charlotte Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d656240-Reviews-Charlotte_Guest_House-London_England.html

"Have mixed impressions about this establishment. I did not realise when booking that that there were separate buildings and all rooms were not en suite, still that was my fault for not doing enough research.In fairness we rang in advance to check that our room was ensuite, it wasn't but the receptionist Anna changed our room without charge.On arrival we were told we were in the other building, the room was large and had a lovely new shower room, however the furniture and bedding had seen better days.

Dinner was amazing. Great pizza and the cod and chips were fab. Breakfast standard greasy spoon type cooked breakfast. Great croissant though! Unfortunately the bed was so uncomfortable!

"We booked in for one night in this hotel and had high expectations based on most of the earlier reviews. On arrival at the check-in desk, the staff appeared to be very busy and it took a while to get our room key, and there was no sign of the supposed 'complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie'. Our room was adequate in size, albeit only for a one or two nights stay and it was a bit of a squeeze to access the wardrobe. Nevertheless the beds were quite comfortable and the room was quiet. However, the biggest letdown was the breakfast in the morning, which is served in an airless subterranean space which is clearly far too small to adequately accommodate the numbers that were endeavouring to eat there. i would have raised this issue with the staff when I checked-out but no-one enquired as to whether we had enjoyed our stay.

I appreciate this but it was very disappointing after a long drive, hoping to check in, freshen up and go for our event. Breakfast was good and I liked the fresh orange juice machine.

"Stayed with a friend for a weekend as we were going to the O2 on the Saturday night. Easy check in, clean but small twin bed room and noon check out. All of this contributed to a good stay.

"I really enjoyed staying here and I do a fair amount of research before staying in a new area of London. I needed to be close to Canary Wharf, but not too close if you know what I mean - so I opted for this hotel in Greenwich seemed to fit the bill perfectly.I expected it to be good, but I didn't expect to be awarding this hotel 5 stars on the very first visit. Aside from the stylish interiors the the breakfast is highly recommend in a peaceful setting that is quite unlike most London hotels. There is a relaxing cocktail bar and the beds are really comfortable too.The staff deserve a special mention though as they were all friendly, but Patricia in guest relations was particularly helpful and professional and is a credit to the team. I will look forward to staying here again.

This was a delight for an afternoon tea that I had an offer on. Was very surprised to find that this was a very beautifully decorated. Walked in and thought wow. The afternoon tea location was near the bar area and was very romantic and cosy. Wasn’t busy when we arrived there was only two other people having afternoon tea was quite spacious and we felt very relaxed and comfortable. We loved the cushions and armchairs. I would recommend this as an afternoon tea as a couples or even as a romantic location.

"Received a very warm welcome when we checked in late on a Friday night. We were given a room on the lower ground floor which offered no view to the outside world. The bathroom was a good size, however the water in the sink had so muckh pressure that it flooded the floor when switched on.",28-Mar-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html
I am a long-standing Hilton customer and this was probably the worst stay in a long time. Rarely write reviews as repeat business is how I prefer to repay good service. I am a diamond member and so would expect my stay preferences on the system to be considered. Instead I got a ground floor room behind the bar. People were smoking outside the room which still managed to come in through a closed window. Woken at 11pm by the fire alarm (not mentioned at checkout). Woken again after that by noisy guests in the room next door through paper thin walls. Breakfast terrible - hot food was cold. Not asked how my stay was at checkout (when I would have gladly told them all this). All in all an absolute shocker and will not use this hotel again. ,27-Mar-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html
"The highlight at this Hilton was the staff. To a person they were thoughtful, hospitable and helpful. It started with Alice, who greeted us on arrival and introduced us to the hotel and continued at every touchpoint. Thank you team!! We had a light meal in the bar and it was value for money and good to eat (both were salads). My husband was delighted that the kitchen remembered to put anchovies on the Cesar Salad. Our room - a standard king - was comfortable and had all you would expect. I would have no hesitation returning to this hotel but would mention that if you prefer to sleep with your window open look for a room with even numbers as those with odd ones look out over the air-conditioning bank which makes for a constant rumble (only with the window open).",24-Mar-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html

"We stayed at this hotel for four nights based on a recommendation by family that had previously stayed on an earlier trip some years ago when it was a Hampton or Hilton. Based on American standards, I found the room to be rather small. However, it did offer a king-size bed which was not always available at other London Hilton-brand hotels. There was a small sitting area when entering the room, but we did not use that other than for storage. The bathroom was clean and nice - toilet worked well and the water pressure for the shower was very good. The bed was comfortable. Storage space is limited and you'll probably end up storing luggage under the desk or in the sitting area if you have much of it.My one minor complaint with the hotel room was that it had no bedside outlets. I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, but did not find a place to plug it in. Only one of the three or four outlets would not accept my power converter. The outlet at the desk was the only one that would accept a power converter. However, there were some bedside USB ports which I used at night to keep my phone charged.This hotel is not centrally located to the major London attractions, but it is a short 5 minute walk to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and was significantly less expensive (£30+) than other more centrally located Hilton properties. I think the benefit to this hotel is that it seems to be situated in a part of London that one would call ""real life"" - a non-tourist part of London where Londoners live, work and commute. We ate at a great pub (The North Pole) that was about a 5 or 6 minute walk away.We ate room service the first night as we got to the hotel around 11pm. Only cold sandwiches were available and we had to take what was available. Our last night we ate one night in the restaurant and the food was OK, but didn't find it great. However, one afternoon we had creamed tea and it was very good.If you want local atmosphere, this is a great place in my opinion.",14-Mar-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html
We had 5 sisters come and visit from Cape Town and chose this hotel for them. Some have traveled extensively so we were not sure. They were absolutely blown away by the service they received.

I really love this hotel. Just the general style of it. i have stayed in a large selection of the rooms though some are quite small they are all quite modern & clean. The restaurant & bar are lovely places to eat & have a drink.The service is always very good. it is a bit out of the way for London but has good links via the DLR & suits where i am visiting.

Well serviced by black cabs and a nice green area right outside the door (to the left - use the ashtrays!). Enjoyed my very short stay. Would recommend. I returned from a meeting in the city late (2330) and had not eaten. There was a very limited room service menu available but I understand that this was a temporary issue.

"I am diamond member at Hilton and I generally associate the doubletree brand with large spacious rooms, big lobbies etc. This property was however more like an autograph collection from Marriott. It appeared to be an older hotel converted to a doubletree (did not check out the details). It’s tucked away in a residential area so hard to spot from the roadside. A very small lobby and similarly small rooms though well appointed. Breakfast was typical British. It’s in a basement and the tables are all crammed up so did not get a grand feeling and you want to just get it done with quickly. I was disappointed with the laundry service as my suit came back not dry cleaned properly. However I just mentioned this while checking out and they waived away the laundry charges. I got it then redone at my next hotel in my itinerary.

"Needed a place to stay for one night near Greenwich. The hotel is about a 15/20 min walk from the Center of Greenwich but it’s a pleasant walk along the high street. Upon arrival I was greeted by My Linh and Andre who were wonderful and so hospitable and gave personal care. The room was brilliant and with so many extra touches it made a business trip feel like a mini break. Breakfast was also great, machines to freshly squeeze juice topped it off.

It’s a short walk from the LDR or a bus stop so idea location.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay, often going above and beyond for us.Breakfast is a little expensive, even if you book the cheap rate the night before but you certainly get your monies worth and the food is lovelyOur room was very clean and for a disabled room was bigger than I expected.We had an evening meal which again was lovely. You get a good choice and the prices are reasonable but the food is definitely worth it.Finally the added touch of leaving me a card and some cupcakes for my birthday was a lovely gift.Overall we had a brilliant stay and would love to go back again.",19-Feb-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html
"We arrived in London at 7am and went straight to the hotel requesting an early check in knowing it was too early. My Tinh i believe her name was, was not only accommodating to our ridiculous request, she said that since we were a Diamond member, she upgraded us. The room was phenomenal. 9th floor, amazing view, beautifully decorated. I slept like a baby and never heard anyone else in the hotel. The shower, though gorgeous with 4 shower heads and a partial glass door was my only complaint. The over head showerhead had very light pressure and all four on together soaked the wall, door, and floor. Very impressive to look at, just not functional. The breakfast was very nice. We loved the evening surprises left in our room Very convenient location. We found the DLR and tube to be much faster than Ubers. The same sweet girl that checked us in was super helpful on our check out in helping us take the underground to the airport.

Visited hotel for afternoon tea and although the hotel looked lovely I was not impressed with the service I received. I was served promptly but not once was I asked if all was ok or if I needed anything else but others dining were asked. The food was pretty basic and the pastries supplied were not great.

"I'm a frequent Hilton guest (diamond status) and I booked this hotel because it was convenient in terms of location and price on my dates. I don't normally book Doubletree, preferring Hiltons, but figured I'd give it a shot.First, the hotel is amazing in terms of appearance - it was an old police station and then a private boutique hotel, and then finally became a Doubletree.Second, the rooms are incredibly modern (probably the most I've seen - and I've stayed at the Conrad in London/St. James 3 times), and while not huge, well laid out and well decorated (there was the history of the crown on the bathroom glass door - really interesting to read!).Finally - the dining room and the bar are the best! Super stylish and well appointed.Service from check-in to bar to check-out were top notch (with one exception - you have to spin a stupid wheel and you win a 'prize' (a free drink, some points, etc.) - kind of takes the class of the hotel down in my opinion to have to do that - just give me a random allocation if you want to do that I guess). The only negative was the location to transport - it was 2 blocks from one and 4 blocks from another one, so not terrible but this isn't the tube, it's the DLR (which means you have to connect), so I took Uber twice because I didn't want to walk.",30-Jan-19,DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3507299-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_London_Greenwich-London_England.html
"My first stay at this excellent hotel and, hopefully, not my last. Although the immediate area is quiet and refined, with a small gardens adjacent, the hotel is conveniently sited near Deptford Bridge DLR station and easy reach of Canary Wharf. For history or leisure fans, the O2 Arena and maritime Greenwich are also nearby. Inside, my room was well sized, comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom doors are worth a special mention, being covered in text outlining significant historic royal events in the borough. A nice touch.

Staff really friendly and helpful. Nice touch with yummie warm cookie on check-out.

"I had booked another nearby IHG hotel earlier this week. Upon arrival, I was informed that the hotel was full and I had been booked into another.Thoroughly annoyed, I was sent to Holiday Inn London - West, where the experience could not have been more different. I was greeted courteously and professionally. My rewards points were posted to my account before I'd even got to the room. This was clean and pleasant, with a great AC system working well.Breakfast was fine - not a big breakfast eater, but fresh fruit was just right - lots of places have unripe fruit, meaning no chance of breakfast. Again, not the case here.Checkout was great - even offered to call a cab to my destination as the other hotel's booking that they'd promised me from the night before was more than 15 minutes late for my meeting.Suffice to say, when I need to be in the Wembley area again, I'll be staying here!",12-Jul-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

Staff too interested in chatting with each other instead of ensuring fully stocked buffet. On first morning there was no orange juice, bacon, hash browns or sausages or plates. When I interrupted the staff members idly chatting one of them brought 6 plates despite the q already bring 9 deep.

The rooms were very comfortable and spotless and also looked to be recently renovated. The location is great as it’s still close to central London and very easily accessible by tube (direct central line access). We also ate at the hotel during our stay and food was very delicious.

Seventh floor view of Gypsy Corner, fourth floor roof terrace looking towards central London and brilliant bar, lounge and restaurant facilities on the ground floor. Choice of excellent coffee, beer and cold drinks. Snacks and meals to suit the time of day. 24 hour cafe for the overnighters and late arrivals. My son has mobility issues and the staff led by Tom Storup, the reception manager went beyond expectations to meet his unique needs.",27-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html
"I have been using this hotel as a base for my commute into central London for work, and its great!This hotel is easily reached by car & has parking, The central tube line a less than a 5min walk, with Oxford Circus only around 25mins away. The hotel itself is modern and spacious with a good sized bar/lounge area & adequate dinning area.Rooms are as expected with Holiday Inn hotels, clean, comfortable beds & pillows and always great powerful showers. On my most recent trip, I was lucky enough to have been given an upgrade, which was really nice. The room was much larger, with a good sized lounge area, great bed & TV at the foot of the bed-a real luxury! Staff at this hotel are also great, nothing is too much trouble, always happy to help and assist & always with a smile. If you are in need of an affordable hotel, with good access into central London, then I would recommend staying here.",25-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html
"I don’t normally leave reviews as stay in a lot of hotels for work. However I feel compelled to leave a review on my recent stays at Holiday Inn, London West. All staff are very friendly, efficient, and clearly confident in their roles. This can only be due to strong management who know how to get the best out of their people. It makes such a difference. I love staying there, the hotel has a great atmosphere. The food is great, a decent choice of beers and wines. The hotel is just great value, near the tube for London and very popular with good reason. Always clean, well looked after. If you stay here you will feel that it exceeds expectations.",24-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html
"We stayed here to go to a concert at Wembley as it was advertised as being near so all good. Checkin was ridiculously slow. Only 2 desks open, and one of them manned by a member of staff who was in training so the queues were ridiculous especially on a Sat afternoon when a bus party arrived .Its not a great first impression. We had a disabled executive room which we were very pleased with. Great bed, pillow choice and toiletries along with the disabled bathroom made it much easier to stay in with my disabilities.Location, There are not many nice food places nearby as it’s just off the A40. However the food in the restaurant was fine for a quick bite before the concert. Bit overpriced but it is “ London “ Breakfast ; very good range and quality to suit most tastes. Bar staff again were slow and seemed too inexperienced to be left on their own to cope with a bar. ordering 4 simple drinks the barman scuttled off , having had to write it down then took 5 mins to make them. Uber to Wembley cost £16 but allow lots of time for traffic, a 3 mile journey took 40 mins obviously due to increased concert traffic. Checkout was as painful as checkin , and staff were confused and tried to charge us for “parking and breakfast” £40 that we had already paid for when I’d checked in the day before. Again not impressed and staff in training. Overall. Good hotel , however staff really let it down. Advice - train your staff on non peak times and have them shadowed/ supported individually.",24-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"Was a little dubious to be staying so far out of the big smoke, but with Ascot on this week, room availability was scarce.However, so glad I took the risk and found this little gem!A few mins walk from the central line at North Acton and the area is absolutely fine for those unsure.The hotel is modern and well appointed.The restaurant was great value too, which was a surprise!I was staying in an Executive Room was lovely.Nothing really to complain about.Only niggle and it is only a niggle was the smell of cigarettes coming through the air con system at about 2am - don’t know why, don’t know how, but lesson learnt for next time and easily fixed - don’t leave the air con on when sleeping.Will certainly stay here again.Great hotel with great staff - ",19-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html
"The hotel is located centrally and convenient for people driving in to London. The hotel is quite modern in its decor. The Rooms and bath are good sized, modern interiors and comfortable. The breakfast spread is excellent and very well made. However, the breakfast area is quite cramped with tables laid out very very close to each other; and can be a bit too close for comfort, especially during busy hours. It has a very basic mini gym; but a swimming pool would have really enhanced the experience. Overall, nice modern hotel for business travellers on short visits to London.",18-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

A massive THANK YOU to the whole team at Holiday Inn London West who were looking after our family over the Bank Holiday weekend in May. We absolutely loved a welcome surprise in the room and an elephant made of towels. Everyone was very attentive and friendly. We had an amazing lunch in the restaurant.

"We booked 2 rooms. Rooms are clean. Beds are comfy. Wonderful breakfast. Easy access ( 10 minutes walk )to London tube ( train station). All the employees are friendly and helpful. Especially receptionist, Francisca, Zanett, Ana , Seymour & Daniela ( pardon me if I spell any of the name incorrectly). On the 1st day, hotel was full & we didn’t get our rooms on the same level. But on the 2nd day morning I came down to the reception desk around 9 am talked to receptionist Francisca to get our rooms on the same level and I was told they’ll try their best because hotel is pretty full . But she asked me to pack our luggage and leave it ready so that they can move once any rooms available on same floor. I honestly didn’t have high expectation to get new rooms on same floor since the hotel was busy as well as all the employees. However, Francisca and her team got it done my request before noon and switched to 2 new rooms on the same floor even though they were busy. Employees from Holiday inn London West 4 Portal Way , Acton are really awesome and amazing. Francisca and above team members do really take care of their customers. I give 5 stars for their customer service!!!",7-Jun-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"We have used this hotel 5 times over the past 2 months as I needed treatment at the Hammersmith Hospital. Parking is easy, rooms well kept and clean. Food is good and there is plenty of space in the coffee bar, bar/restaurant.However what makes this a gem of a find is the staff. Professional, friendly and always ready to help. If there has been a slight blip (On first stay the tv did not work we were moved rooms immediately without question) it has been resolved quickly and with good humour. Strangers at first to the area the desk staff went out of their way to help us find appropriate transport and explained how paying on London transport works. The surrounding area is under development but no way should this deter people who want a base to explore London. 3 min walk to underground station and 1 minute walk to the bus stop.Feel at home here guys - thank you.",19-May-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html
"Booked Acton since the Wembley hotel was well overpriced for the FA cup final night.I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was very friendly and we were able to check in very early. We were given drinks vouchers due to our membership without having to ask.Our room was on the 7th floor. Nice, clean and airy with a lovely view of London! Good amenities too. We had none of the noise issues I’ve read about.I was disappointed with the GF options at dinner. I was given a sheet with the only options available the sauces, mixed vegetables, fruit salad or vegetable chilli. I asked the waiter why I couldn’t have a steak and baked potato but he said they had to be fried. Didn’t understand so I settled with a fruit salad. There are notices around about asking but I don’t think the staff are trained.Ilona looked after us at the bar and breakfast the following morning. She really is a lovely helpful member of staff and I hope you recognise her for me.Breakfast was better than Wembley by far. GF bread was brought promptly and there was plenty of options I could eat.If dinner had been better I would have given 5* but this should be worked on please!

"We stayed on Friday last on a bed and breakfast basis and were given an upgrade to an executive room on the second floor. We were looking for a Hotel at reasonable prices and easy access to Central London. The room was spacious, clean and finished to a high standard of decoration with en suite bathroom with a bath and separate shower. Free wi-fi is provided throughout the Hotel. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and TV. We opted for an additional English Breakfast, it was an additional £18 for a high quality self service with a lot of choice including fruit, cereals toast and continental choices. Parking at the Hotel is an additional £15 per day.The Hotel is located in North Acton and we a little trouble navigating to the rear of the Hotel as it is busy one way roads outside. It is however a 4-5 minute walk to North Acton underground station on the Central line. Change at Notting Hill Gate for the Central line and Central London. A 30-40 minute journey dependent on service. The staff are professional and friendly.

"Having stayed at this hotel for business purposes in the past , I decided that I would take my partner with me for along weekend.We were not disappointed with the fantastic service from booking in from the staff at check in. They were polite and very welcoming to us and couldn’t do enough for us and made us very welcome.The room was most excellent as we stayed in the executive suite. The room was very clean and welcome with a choice of pillows to choose from, the bed was large enough for three,if required..! The bathroom was also clean with lots of body wash and hair products to keep you fresh and clean. The towels were nice and clean and fresh and made of quality cotton and not some cheap materials.The view from the room overlooked west London and you see central London from a distance, not bad considering the hotel is located next to the A40 into central London. We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we were going out to meet friends in London, but I’ve had a meal in the restaurant before and it was good food. The breakfast in the morning was also very good, with plenty of options from a full English to a continental breakfast and lots of fresh fruit and cereals.Transport links are plentiful too with North Acton tube station a 5 min walk from the the hotel which will take you straight into central London or you can walk to Acton Mainline Railway station and take a train into London Paddington or you could go west to towards Slough and Reading.Overall a great stay and will definitely be staying there again on my next visit to London .Great staff and service, thank you and see you soon.",29-Mar-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"Booked this hotel because I couldn't get one nearer central London at a reasonable price. Actually, really pleased I went to this hotel rather than a central London one. This hotel is on the tube, at North Acton. About 7 minutes walk from the tube station. On the walk there's a Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express if, like me, you needed to get something to eat. I arrived at the hotel between 8pm and 9pm and many were in the hotel restaurant. If you don't want to eat there, nor something from one of the supermarkets nearby, there's a huge Macdonald's across the road from the hotel.On arrival at the hotel, the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful if they'd tried. They even offered me a Kit Kat choc bar, as I must have seemed very tired from that day's work and travel.My room was big. If I was into cruelty, it was more than big enough to swing a cat. The room and bathroom was clean. In the bathroom there was a wet room shower, which was great. I was on the 1st floor, the same floor at the meeting/conference rooms and executive suites, it was quiet all night.The big double bed had clean bedding and was very comfy.Breakfast was included. It was a help yourself type. All the usual choices.The down side of staying at this hotel?

We were using the hotel conference rooms and also staying. We have been traveling during our sales season all over the country for the last 4 weeks and stayed at many different hotels however this one really exceeded our expectations for customer service. From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had a van to unload and although car park gets quite busy we were able to unload easily into the 1st floor conference room mayfair. The room was ready for us and cleaned daily during the stay with water and cups etc refreshed without having to ask and any member of staff we met be it from house keeping to reception always smilled and greeted us. A very ample breakfast and very clean and tidy around all aspect of what is a busy hotel. Any question or query we had was met with a friendly and efficent manner. We had several visitors at the hotel and there needs were also well catered for. It is very near the busy A40 but for ease of getting into or out of London it is very well placed with a tube line nearby. Also to have a car park with easy access despite the current roadworks and not a ridiculous daily rate. As the rooms are elevated above ground level. and well sound proofed so you are not aware of the road.,28-Feb-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"Our stay was amazing. Francesca was so sweet and accommodating. They had beautiful swans on our bed for the celebration of our anniversary. They kept water in our frig and when we left out converter they gave us one on borrow. We were about 7 minutes walk from the North Action tube station! The rooms were clean and bigger than expected! Beds were comfy and pillows you want to take home. There is a Tesca store, subway, domino's pizza, McDonald's and coffee shop all in walking distance. Great staff all around! I would recommend and stay again!! Thank you again",19-Feb-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"I’ve been here for 8 nights and should’ve actually went home. Unfortunately, work didn’t go as planned today, so after having checked out this morning, I checked back in again tonight.Upon walking back in the hotel, a young lady called Paula spotted me and said “shouldn’t you have gone home?”.Now that’s quite nice that a member of staff realises you shouldn’t be here, in a good way. So it’s nice to be nice and I think Paula deserves a mention, as she is always helpful.Hotel ideally located for getting to / from centre and my two downsides are; parking can be a bit a pain at times, as can the noise off the A40.",7-Feb-19,Holiday Inn London - West,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d313125-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_London_West-London_England.html

"The front desk staff at this hotel made a real difference to our stay - Benjamin and Anais. They went out of their way to make our stay a very memorable one (help with printing travel tickets, booking cab, additional information on attractions). They were very welcoming and friendly which made our visit a very pleasant experience. The hotel was close to the train station and kept very clean.

"My wife and I stayed 1 night for a Wembley concert and boy were we lucky to find 55. On check in the place was very smartly presented, very classy. The staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble and very attentive.The room 201 was great but after a couple of minutes we were given an unexpected upgrade to 207. Very large very comfortable bed in a spacious, spotless room with huge Trv, coffee machine and complimentary water, tea and coffee. A beautiful garden compliments the hotel that I would term as an Oasis in a concrete jungle. The only picky point was the minibar prices, £7.40 for a £2 bottle of wine. But hey ho there's a supermarket outside. All in all great vfm and very enjoyable.Thanks 55 see you again.",24-Jun-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

We stayed at the hotel after our Airbnb fell through. It was lovely and very reasonably priced hotel which is close to transport links.

"We've just returned from our latest trip to London and, as usual, stayed in Hotel 55. Benjamin and the team are such a nice bunch and are genuinely interested in their guests. Because we're regulars, we were upgraded to a garden suite which was such a nice gesture. The hotel is spotless and the rooms are very nice. I'd suggest asking for a Garden Room, if possible, as it's nice and quiet. The hotel is very conveniently located. North Ealing tube is minutes away and only a 10 mins walk to Ealing Broadway. There's a nice Italian and Indian restaurant as well as a pub within a minutes walk of the hotel so all in all Hotel 55 is a real gem.",8-Jun-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

"Fabulous small hotel. Rooms aren't huge but that wasn't expected in an older building like this. Shower pressure is amazing and so is the service. Mike at the front desk is the best and Jan puts forth an amazing Continental breakfast each day. I can't say enough about how much I like this place. Parking is limited, so plan accordingly. But don't miss this place. Very reasonably priced and very much a more homey and intimate experience than a large hotel. I stayed 2 days but would have loved to stay longer.

"So happy to have found this gem of a hotel. I searched for weeks trying to find a nice hotel with parking and near a tube station and this one definitely ticked all the boxes. Me and my partner stayed here on the 30th March 2019 and loved it, I originally booked a street view room but as it was my fiancé’s 21st birthday I emailed the hotel asking whether I would be able to upgrade.Benjamin was lovely and said that he would leave a note on our reservation for a nice room - so we got there and were put into a garden view room which was lovely.As they knew it was my partners birthday they left a little note in the room and also gave him two bottles of Prosecco and a plate of grapes, strawberries and chocolate - which was a lovely gesture.The hotel is by North Ealing tube station but as Ealing Broadway station was only about a 10 minute walk away, me and my partner used that one because it’s a central line. I’m always a bit wary of walking around anywhere at night but Ealing is such a lovely place, I felt very safe walking to and from the station/hotel at night. When we come back to London we will definitely be booking this hotel again.",1-Apr-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

"Stayed as a family of two adults and two small children in room 009 which is a suite. It's London so the rooms are not massive but they have been clever with the space and lighting in the rooms. There are very nice l'occitane products which is a nice touch. The room had a small kitchen area in it and owing to the young age of the kids we just bought some milk and honey nut cornflakes in the shop which was less than a minutes walk away.The tube is only a minute or so away and is an easy journey into London on the picadilly line which takes about 20 minutes to reach the centre. The hotel has about five parking spaces but they were pretty much in use the entire time. We just parked the car in the middle, unloaded it and then drove around the corner for free weekend parking. (turn left and then left again at the Italian restaurant and that road has loads of parking)We didn't see many staff when we were there but we didn't have any problems with our stay. We would consider staying again if going got another weekend away here. ",10-Mar-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

"We stayed here for 2 nights for the weekend with our teenage son for a London trip.We had 2 rooms, neither of which looked much like the hotel website rooms but were perfectly adequate.Beds were comfy and rooms nice and quiet at night.Downsides were no milk provided for with tea/ coffee facilities, very sung bathroom and no plug socket near the mirror for my wife to dry her hair. We ate breakfast both mornings and that was adequate although service could have been a little more welcoming ( no explanation to help yourself to continental breakfast or any offer of cooked breakfast- we had to ask). Despite this location is great - station into London right behind the hotel and taking 20- 25 minutes.",1-Mar-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"Had to find an affordable Hotel in London for the night and so many are sooo expensive in London - so I opted for the Hotel 55 as it was so much more affordable than Zone 1 that's for sure! The Tube (North Ealing) is just a 2 minute stroll away and it is only a 25 - 30 minute ride into the centre. Check-in was a breeze and the welcome was really down to earth and friendly. The Hotel has no lift, but I only had a ruck sack, but the nice thing was I was still asked if I needed a hand with my luggage. My room was of a 4 Star Standard and I slept amazingly well! Plenty of hot water in the morning was great from the power shower - which I could of stayed under all day!.lol... Free Wifi was a bonus and the signal was great. Free Bottled of Water was great to glug and Nespresso Machine was a nice touch too! The Complimentary Continental Breakfast (as I booked direct) was sufficient and filled me up for the morning as it was buffet style - so help yourself was great! The public areas were great - I imagine the garden and its terrace is lovely in the Summer, but the lounge area and its ""library"" feel is very relaxing. All in all I will be definitely booking as the price was great and the Tube is just £2.80 into the City after 9.30 am! The Staff definitely make the Hotel too..Everyone was so down to earth, no heirs or graces like the big hotel chains..Customer Service skills are to be commended to be honest! I will be back and book again direct because of the free continental breakfast - I love the word free!..Thank you!!",15-Feb-19,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

"All in all, a nice hotel, with lovely but small rooms, friendly staff and an upmarket feel. A powerful shower is great in the morning, but my room being on the second floor did tax my knees a little, no lift. I liked the nice touches like a fridge in the room, but the fancy nespresso coffee machine with nothing to use in it confused me. Had to go and ask for normal teabags too, had every type but. The continental breakfast is pretty basic, but adequate for people who want a bowl of cereal and some toast, or fruit. The biggest thing for me was the parking. I was staying the whole week, and not once did I get parked in front of the hotel. It was a case of the station car park or finding one on the street in between permit times. After a day at work, car park roulette wasn't my idea of fun. I was booked for the following week, but cancelled mainly because of that. Great place for a cpl nights, and meters from the local underground, its great for a break, but as a weeks base for work, not so much. I didn't sample the Japanese restaurant on the site, not really partial to that cuisine.

The decor was beautiful, the water pressure better then at home, toiletries luxurious and plentiful, the breakfast fresh and delicious. But the best thing was the staff.

"Came here for an overnighter, was well received and efficiently given my card to my room, there is only 4 maybe 5 car parking places at the front of the hotel, I believe there is some around the back end of the hotel but not sure. Room was cosy Air Con was switched off, I switched on to get some air and even tho it was on 18 it was blowing really warm, so I switched off and opened a window. Obviously that let in traffic noise as it’s right on the main road. The tube is literally 2 mins away. If you need somewhere to park on a weekend the stations car park is only 2 quid all day Saturday and I think Sunday. It’s just past the hotel and turn right, then it’s slightly to the right I think. Hotel was good a bit pricey for what it was but it’s location mainly, I didn’t eat there so can’t tell you about momo the Japanese restaurant. The tea, coffee and water where free in the room so extra bonus for serving fruit tea too. All in all I would go again especially if you want to visit London.

"I stayed here for the night as it is very near my daughter's new home. I was lucky enough to get one of the very few parking spaces outside the hotel but I was told there was plenty of free parking in the road behind the hotel or paid parking at the car park at the tube station.The tube was less than five minutes walk from the hotel (Piccadilly Line) and only 30 minutes ride to central London.My room (007) was pretty small but fine for me, comfortable bed, nice coffee maker and a great shower (again the bathroom was small but adequate).Front desk staff were all helpful and friendly.The only problem was that the corridor outside my room (on the ground floor) was bitterly cold as the outside door was kept propped open and this cold air got into my room. Sound proofing wasn't brilliant but it didn't bother me, a child crying in the room next door woke me up a number of times (not the hotel's fault I completely understand) and I could also easily hear the shower in the room above.Having said that I would certainly stay here again and would recommend.",28-Oct-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"I got to this hotel late in the evening after the restaurant was closed, and the really terrific front desk guy grabbed me a yogurt parfait from the back fridge. The staff were all super.Be aware that there is no lift in the hotel. It's only two floors, but with a lot of luggage, this could be an issue. A bigger issue for me was the size of my room. There was literally no room for a suitcase - the bed took up the entire room with only a sliver of space in between the bed and the wardrobe and on the other side, the bed and the window. I had to roll across the bed to get from one side of the room to the other! I basically had to keep my (roll-aboard) suitcase closed and in the bathroom, which was equally tiny.I think there are larger rooms but apparently they were in noisier parts of the hotel. It was clean, cool, and quiet (although my window faced some sort of walkway with very bright lights on late into the night) - and I don't mind tiny - but no place to walk in the room, much less work out of it if needed.

"I stayed here for a single night due to working in the area. It made a great change to the routine of chain hotels (which made up most of the others on offer in the surrounding area). I walked from the Tube station (North Ealing) - it’s no more than five minutes to walk and the hotel was easy to find.At check-in I was greeted by a friendly staff member who was keen to make sure I had everything I needed both for my stay and also for my departure (he wanted to be sure that I knew there would be tube strikes that could get in the way of my travel plans the following day).The room I had was fairly snug, not too small but it could probably be better laid-out for space (there wasn’t a desk, just a narrow dressing table that was already full with coffee machine, kettle, glasses, mugs, tea/coffee). As I was travelling for work a better space for setting up my laptop would have been helpful.At check-in I was warned that the TV reception was poor (they were awaiting an engineer) but the WiFi was working so I didn’t miss not having a good TV service.The room is obviously not newly decorated, but still in reasonable condition, and the decor is modern and well considered.The shower room was adequate, again not spacious, but not the smallest I have encountered.It was noticeable that I could hear other guests (in particular in the corridor outside my room) but it wasn’t sustained throughout the evening/night.Breakfast the following morning was good, a nice selection of cereals, pastries, fruits, yogurt etc.",28-Sep-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

Bus goes from outside the hotel straight to the stadium so really handy but also easy to walk - about 35 mins & we did this coming back. Hotel room was small but clean, comfy bed & well equipped with water & nice coffee machine. We were in Room 7 ground floor & it was a bit noisy during the night with other hotel guests coming & going & sound of TV in the room next door but to be expected in a small hotel. We parked on Ealing station car park behind the hotel Saturday morning until Sunday lunch £3.90 so great for London & found a lovely little Italian right behind the hotel where we ate on the Saturday evening.

"Beware , the Rooms are small, Very small. Staff is polite, but they cant help change the room.The marketing was misleading, may lead you to think otherwise. This property is a old house which has been badly modernised.??Issue is that the description could be better. ?? I booked a family room as we had our 11 year old child , we were told family room is available. And that there is free parking.??When I reached there I realised the house ( sorry hotel ) oh !! Sorry the house .. had 4 parking bays for 28 guests..so I went hunting road side parking .??The family room was a small converted ATIC and the SO CALLED GARDEN view was a view of a half grass patch !! And yes while you can shuffle from point A to Point B in the room, in the bathroom you would be lucky to move you hand to brush your teeth.??The only saving grace, it was clean. ??And yes the continental cold breakfast was NOT arranged properly for humans and the flies that were tasting the food made me get up hungry.??So try at your risk.??One good thing worth mentioning though is that the staff was polite and smiling.

"Our usual London haunt was booked out for last weekend so I googled ""hotels close to Ealing Broadway"" and up popped Hotel 55. The reviews were mainly very good so we took a chance and we are so glad we did. The hotel couldn't be in a better location for exploring London. North Ealing tube station is literally 2 minutes walk away. For all you theatre lovers, you can get straight into Leicester Square from there within approx 30 mins. Coming from Heathrow Airport, take the Picadilly Line tube to Acton Town and continue on the Picadilly Line to North Ealing (that line branches out but doesn't go directly to North Ealing). Ealing Broadway village is only 10 minutes walk away, where there are loads of shops and restaurants to check out. Now, back to the hotel! The hotel is spotless and is more than a 3 star to be honest. It's immaculate. Our room was small but had everything we needed. Bottled water and L'Occitane products are standard in the room so no need to drag bottles of shower gel and shampoo/conditioner with you as the stuff is lovely! The staff are very nice and friendly and happy to help/provide information about getting around London etc. We've already booked a trip back for October and can't wait! Many thanks Hotel 55 and see you soon!!! :)",7-Aug-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
This time last year our son moved to London for his year out. I booked to stay in Hotel 55 as it was near to where he moved. I was so impressed that my husband and I went back this year when visiting our son. The hotel is small which gives it a family friendliness which is lacking in bigger chains. It is spotlessly clean and the rooms have everything for a short stay. The restaurant is Japanese and very good quality. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating. It is close to a couple of different tube stations and within walking distance of Ealing town centre. I highly recommend Hotel 55. ,21-Jul-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"We stayed one night in June to visit central London. We chose this hotel due to needing free parking (although is very limited so would confirm and arrive early to secure a spot) and it’s location being extremely close to the metro and in a safe area. This boutique hotel is refurbished to a lovely modern style and our room was lovely with nice clean and shiny shower En-Suite. I must admit I didn’t have the best night sleep due to street noise, too much street/ neighbors lights through the windows (even with blinds down) and a door kept banging shut (perhaps the reception door to the stairs? As we were on the first floor) throughout the night and guests arriving during the early hours... I’m a light sleeper but it didn’t bother my husband, perhaps a room on a higher floor would be quieter. The North Ealing tube station is literally a 2 minute walk around the corner making it very easy to get in and out of central London. Would recommend this hotel for style and convenience, but I’d choose a different room next time.",26-Jun-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
Stayed here for Ed Sheeran concert .. booked this months ago. Emailed hotel advising that my daughter has Blue Badge & could we have a space outside. No reply so when we arrived we saw the outside parking of approx 4 cars was full so had to park at the Tube Station. Man on reception when we checked in didn’t seem bothered & said although we could park in front of hotel & leave the keys .. he couldn’t drive so that was pointless. I explained how worried I was about leaving car in tube car park with blue badge but he offered no othe.Found our room 110 .. although it was a modern clean room .. it was so small .. everything was miniature! It was a double room with garden view but the view was over some outbuilding then into the garden! There was one chair .. nowhere to put anything & the bathroom was equally small .. it was so claustrophobic that we couldn’t wait to leave the next day.We usually use the Holiday Inn at Wembley but it was full .. for £98 for this hotel I’d definitely look elsewhere as it’s not worth the money.We won’t be returning.,20-Jun-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"We used this hotel due to going to a concert at Wembely, The staff were lovely and helpful. The rooms are nice and spacious as well as a very comfy bed.We did have a room overlooking the road and didn't hear the noise from the road except for the occasional siren but that is understandable. Breakfast was really good , would be able to have something even if you didn't like certain things. The brilliance of this hotel is that the tube is just round the corner so even though it's not far out of the centre it's easy to get to the centre or even Wembley. Will definitely be using this hotel again.",18-Jun-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"We stayed here on Friday night as we were going to a concert at Wembley. The hotel is modern, clean and chic. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We booked a ‘Garden Room ‘ for ourselves got a lovely suite! And a “Street View” room for our Son but it still looked over the rear, so very peaceful. There is a pretty, tranquil garden outside the restaurant ( which is Japanese). Breakfast was beautifully laid out and delicious, with all you could want. We will certainly use this hotel again, highly recommended. ",17-Jun-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html

"My husband, son and I stayed here one night after visiting Wembley. The hotel had free parking which was a bonus. Very clean and modern hotel with a lovely restaurant on site. Mike on front desk was exceptionally helpful. Very nice staff. Rooms were tastefully decorated with some nice in room facilities such as free coffee water etc. Equipped with coffee machine, nespresso pods and bottled water. Kettle, fridge, hairdryer and iron also added to making this hotel one of the nicest we’ve ever stayed in in London. Hotel was situated minutes from train and tube station to take you directly into central London, but there was lots of nice bars and restaurants within minutes walk. Ealing Broadway is a great little shopping centre with nice high street shops and only 10 minutes walk away. A very pleasant and enjoyable stay. Will definitely be returning and recommending.

"We stayed for four nights, our room overlooked the right hand side of the building, we had read other reviews which had suggested the front rooms could be noisey.We were were happy with our room and had three good nights sleep.The bed was comfy and we had a selection of soft or firm pillows.

"Had a weekend trip with my wife whilst helping our son move to student accommodation in Ealing. Found the accommodation on-line and the booking of it was easy. It is fairly close to Ealing Broadway shopping and tube station, and the tube into central London is just over 20 mins, so is well connected. The hotel has very nice bedrooms that are equipped as you would expect but has a lovely ambience. Very comfortable beds and a nice shower/bathroom. The rooms have minibars available along with a kettle and a selection of teas/coffees The decor is modern and appealing throughout. We did not eat in the Japanese restaurant that is connected but we did have breakfast which was a very nice continental style affair. The only real issue was the lack of parking with only 4 usable spaces available. The reception seemed to be manned 24/7 which is unusual for this size of hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something different from a Premier Inn or similar and I will be staying there again if we end up going to that neck of the woods again.",18-Jan-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"Stayed here for 1 night NYE with my fiancé, only 4 car park spaces so had to park in the train station car park and walk round. was less than 5 mins walk so didn't mind to much. Guy on the reception was really friendly and got us checked in really quick. First impression, quirky little hotel, easy to find. nice lay out on inside. room was quite small but was enough for one night. Few things that let it down (not their fault) but it was very noisy, we got back to the room and 2:30am after seeing the fireworks, music was blasting somewhere in the hotel and could hear the traffic noise from outside.few other things, the bed was quite hard, the shower did not get hot act all, even on the hottest temperature setting it was merely over lukewarm and the flush on the toilet was broken. overall an average stay for the night, but those few things let it down, would have stayed here again otherwise",3-Jan-18,Hotel 55,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d617244-Reviews-Hotel_55-London_England.html
"Stopped here with my trusted travelling partner, who I believe has become far more critical than me in his 9 years of travel! We gave this hotel a thumbs up, a pleasant surprise just outside Central London and no more than 2min walk to the tube station. The hotel is on a main road and if the carpark is full on road parking is available. We did not notice the noise of the main road. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite. Unfortunately MOMO was closed but it is Christmas and we all need a break at some point. Would I stay here again? Yes. Decor is modern and reflected throughout the hotel not just the lobby as is often the case. We were a 10min drive from white city and with pre payment parked just off Oxford Street for £19 covering twelve hours.....cheaper than tube tickets for the whole family.

As the Saturday night stay at the Hub was nearly three times the price of a Sunday, we booked for Sunday and arrived early enough to have one of the Hub's breakfasts before booing in at 2pm. The all-you-can-eat breakfasts are amazing value compared with the many chains offering over-priced coffee in the surrounding area. We were also taking advantage of the abundant free on street parking in the area over the weekend but made sure we were back on the road by 8.30am on the Monday when the draconian parking fees kick in.

"This is copy/pasted from my review that will go directly to the hotel:The room I was allocated (7) was far too hot and the cooling, set to 18 degrees, simply did not work. After ten mins of listening to the heat exchanger attempt to cool down I discovered only about 1cm in the top right corner was working, suggesting insufficient coolant. I note there were coolant leak detectors at floor level so the possibility and expectation of leaks must have been designed into the building. I asked to move room but the lady at reception tried to tell me the air conditioning to my room might have been off centrally. She told me to go and wait 20 mins in my room (this was around midnight). I returned as there was no cooling effort at all. She said the hotel was fully booked and I couldn't move room, nor could I try to move to a nearby Premier Inn, should one have had room. She said they were separate companies. A manager overheard the conversation and moved me to room 51. On starting the air conditioning, set to 18, within a minute gurgling was heard and slightly more of the heat exchanged became cold than in room 7 (so an improvement), but again, I suspect there was insufficient coolant present. The heat exchanger should get quite cold and wet when in operation in a warm humid environment. The room was far too hot all night. I really was not impressed with my stay and I suspect faults are now starting to appear that are not being rectified now these new-build hotels are ageing.",3-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12503727-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_King_s_Cross-London_England.html
"This hub is accessible because of its location and price. It is fun because of its use of technology and the tongue in cheek humour of its signage and the warm attitude of the staff.

No major complaints clean room and shower with decent pressure.,1-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12503727-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_King_s_Cross-London_England.html
"We had a one night stay here last night. At check in, we were told that 4 of our 8 rooms were not yet ready, despite it being 2.30pm (check in is 2.00pm). This meant that we had to store our luggage and change clothes in our friend's rooms until ours were available. Despite this slight setback, our stay was enjoyable. The rooms are small but ample and the bed had the usual Premier Inn super comfortable trademark. Excellent shower too.

"Too much technology, not enough attention to detail.

"This was our first stay at Hub. If I could get a decent rate again,then I would consider staying here again. It reminded us of a Scandinavian contemporary hotel. We were impressed by the slick check in process, even if we did need a little bit of help. Our room was quiet throughout our stay despite looking out over Kings Cross station. Breakfast in the hotel was lovely and all we needed for our start to the day.Staff were pleasant, friendly efficient and very helpful which is s refreshing for the Capital. If you're expecting a large room, the this is not the hotel for you. But we loved it having stayed in something similar in Holland a few years ago.

Very compact. Lots of power outlets. Some effective use of space luke storage under the bed. Aircon that works.Breakfast was fine freshly baked pastries real orange juice. Not a long walk to the Eurostar. ,29-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12503727-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_King_s_Cross-London_England.html
"The Hub is down the street from the Premier Inn (we went to the wrong one first!); it's okay but very much a stop and drop kind of place. It isn't that handy for the tube (but you just have to walk up quite a long street), the rooms are very small and noisy (the plumbing and the air conditioning but the outside noise isn't that bad) but is big enough for one person. There is free tea and coffee but only in the lounge and you get left one bottle of water per visit (so I had one bottle to last both nights!). The staff are friendly and the breakfast (although I didn't have it) is only £5 for a cold buffet. The shower is a rainforest one and is quite large, the ensuite is a decent size. Also the hubs do not have a good night guarantee",29-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12503727-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_King_s_Cross-London_England.html
"Easy check in, clean room I booked standard fine for one person but squeeze for two to move around in. Worth upgrade to bigger room. Very modern, no road noise or from adjoining rooms or corridor. Enough lifts. Bar great but we drank it dry though to be fair didn't warn them 40 plus attending cocktails which were fab. Breakfast good continenta but one coffee machine broke and queue for toaster.

Stayed for access to Eurostar and had a very good experience. Rooms are very compact but full of tech and the staff were very helpful and friendly.

"We booked a pretty last minute girls weekend, group of 5 ladies, in London, for fab shows, drinks, shopping and more. This hotel ended up being an excellent choice!

"Arrived with low expectations only to be blown away. From the greeting to the goodbye I can't fault this hotel. Pristinely clean, compact rooms but well thought out stylish and more than adequate.

"Attended a wedding locally and wanted somewhere convenient to stay. Hadn't tried a HUB but very pleasantly surprised and will certainly use them again, if possible.

"We thought the Hub was brilliant.The staff couldn’t have been more helpfull, the room was great, we booked a larger room and I think that was the right thing for us to do as we are an older couple and a bed right up to the wall is no good to us, fine for a solo traveler.

"I'm a big fan of Premier Inn not because they're amazing but they are absolutely reliable and always clean and comfortable. Was a bit wary of the hub concept but after some reassurance I stayed 2 nights here and found it really good. Single room had a very large and comfortable bed, a clever pull out desk which was perfect for a laptop, and a really nice en-suite shower room. Free tea and coffee 24/7 in the bar downstairs. What more do you need? Only negative was a somewhat noisy room due to a gurgling aircon or drainage system but it didn't bother me really. Would definitely use again for business trips.",22-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12503727-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_King_s_Cross-London_England.html
All services great other than faulty aircon in the room. It's very loud and sounds broken. The room was very hot as we had to turn it off to try and sleep. Unfortunately we couldn't get to sleep due to the heat. We slept with no covers on and still were too hot. To top it off the aircon kept turning itself on every so often so when we managed to drift off for a second it woke us back up again so we had to keep turning it off. Room 6004.

Good shower and hotel was in good condition. Couldn’t complain about anything had two wonderful staff members at the bar to greet me when I walked in I think there names were joão and Betina lovely smiles and very helpful could say they made my morning.

Spent one night here this week and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were small but perfectly formed. Configuration of the double bed wouldn't suit all. Checking in was different [fully automated with someone on standby if you got stuck]. Breakfast for a fiver next day was a revelation.

Me and my partner really enjoyed our stay at the hub it was fantastic would highly recommend it. had a great staff member João that had a few minutes to talk to us about GOSH and convinced us to also leave the tip of five pounds that we wanted to give to him to the charity pot that they had a the bar.

"The room is small, but super clean and fun. It’s right next to the train station called St. James, making getting *anywhere* a breeze. Breakfast was a buffet for only 6£! What a steal!Our room was cleaned every day, minus the one we asked them not to clean. We did laundry in our room using the bathroom sink which worked great. Staff was super friendly, willing to help with any needs, adding to the overall greatness of the hotel. Highly recommend this hotel if you can manage in a bit smaller area. There’s too much to do in the city to do anything but just here sleep anyway... (You can still eat at the hotel even if you don’t stay with them. 6£ is a super affordable for what they offer - not to mention it’s all you can eat.)",13-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html

Just what we needed and exactly as described. All staff so pleasant and eager to help. Room very basic but very comfortable and enough room for one night stay.

"I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The concept is so ingenious, the rooms are tiny, but efficient, comfortable, clean, aesthetically pleasing and kind of pretty cool with all the gadgets around the bed. I was not sure what to expected but left very happy. The location is excellent, just a few minutes walk away from the Westminster Cathedral, Big Ben, St. Jame's Park and the palace. The staff was very helpful. We arrived at the hotel at 8 am, after an overnight bus trip, hoping they would keep our luggage until the check-in time, and to our surprise they told us our room was ready. Breakfast was just OK since I prefer hot breakfast options. I highly recommend this hotel for those looking for great location for the best price.",12-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html

"For our first time in London, it was overwhelming in deciding where to stay, but based on reviews, we chose this hotel and so happy we did! A truly great and most affordable stay! I will say I was a bit worried about space as my husband and I are more ""Pooh"" sized, but the worries were for nothing. We booked the bigger room and it was phenomenal! A place for luggage, ample storage and hangers, and the most wonderful, roomy, bed!! It was the most comfortable bed we slept in throughout our entire UK trip!! Plus with the bigger room, you are able to have access to both sides of the bed so no crawling over each other. The lounge was nice as well with complimentary coffee and tea all day/night. After a long day sightseeing it was nice to spend time in the lounge and have some tea and discuss the events of the day. The breakfast in the mornings was a great choice as well, with eggs, sausage, bacon, breads/pastries, fruit, yogurt, etc. for only £6. The location of this hub was excellent with St. James' tube stop less than a 5 minute walk and Westminster Abbey just down the road. There is a Pret-a-Manger before the tube station and a couple of other restaurants and pubs as well. Highly recommend this hotel and the wonderful staff!",11-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
"We had a posh do to go to near Trafalgar Square last night so booked The Hub having always liked the main Premier Inn offering. We weren’t sure what to expect but it exceeded expectations. Clean comfortable room, great shower, good bar and lounge to relax in and a terrific breakfast at an amazing price.

"The location of this hotel couldn't better - very central and very convenient. As described in their publicity, the rooms are small. Our room had a window (that couldn't be opened); the bed was large and very comfortable; there was enough space to store our suitcase and clothes; the air-conditioning worked well and kept the room chilled; lighting worked very well; bathroom was very clean with an excellent shower unit; the room was very quiet with no external noise at all; with one exception, all the staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. The exception was the young lady who booked us in; she obviously had an agenda and declined to talk to me (a male) and looked and talked to my wife, very obviously ignoring me. A pity she was like this because everyone else was great. The breakfasts are outstanding value! Bacon, eggs, sausages, pastries, fruits, yoghurts, cereals, breads, drinks etc and all for £6.00. There is a large and comfortable lounge/bar. Given the location in the centre of London, this place represents good value for money, without the frills.

The location was convenient to many attractions and close to the subway station (only a 2 block walk). The room was clean and had everything we could need. The staff were friendly and held our luggage when we arrived so we could start sightseeing before check-in time.

"Located right in the middle of everything, you're within walking distance to just about all the major sights (or a short Tube ride away, as the nearest station is literally down the street). The rooms are compact but there's a place for everything without ever feeling cramped, and I really like the touch-based technology for controlling everything from lights to AC to do not disturb.

"Knew the room was small when we booked, didn't quite realise how much we'd miss having two sides to the bed. As a couple i'd say a little too cramped. everything was good but the room lost out there. My biggest annoyance was that there are no beverage making facilities in the room. The location is absolutely spot on.

"We arrived at the after a short trip on the London Express and the Underground. The St James's Park underground is a block away. Check in was easy. We got the ""bigger"" room, on the 7th floor (Rm 722). Had a small window, and the A/C worked great (very warm that week). Room was a good size for -2-. Couldn't imagine having more than 2 in that room. Bed was very comfy, and plenty of pillows on request. Bathroom spacious. Room was kept clean for our -7- day stay. We got the breakfast included, and it was well worth it. Eggs, bacon, sausage, breads, coffees , teas, etc. Very good. Out the front door, to the left -1- block is Westminster Abbey and a 5 minute walk is the River Thames and Big Ben. Loved the location. there are plenty of nearby Pubs (Feathers to name our fav) within a block. There is a pub in the hotel, but they ran out of red wine and other liquors. Still, nice place to hang out. We would definitely come back here again.

"We had a ""bigger"" room. I think the beds in the regular rooms are up against the wall and allow access to only one side. The small window in our room had a view of the outside through a small corridor to another window. Definitely better than our inside room on the Queen Mary 2, but just barely. We had trouble controlling the lights but could eventually get them to turn on or off. The 6 Lb. (about $7.65) breakfast was great!

"We booked the Premier hub for the weekend as we were going to see Barbara Streisand at the Hyde Park open air concerts. It was an excellent choice as it catered for our needs right across the board and was populated by delightful accommodating staff. The bedroom was very good, it's small but ideal for the purpose. The bed is extremely comfortable and it was a very relaxing place. If we had used our heads we would have had breakfast there but we assumed it was just a continental breakfast! (Aren't we stoopid?!, accent on the stupid there) It wasn't but never mind we'll know next time. The next time we stay in a hub we will be prepared and have a full English.

"What can i say. It met all my expectations and more. Its in a fantastic location just a few minutes from Westminster abbey, parliament square, Westminster bridge and the london eye. Its clean, modern and the staff are great. Theres a bar and free coffee and tea in the lounge. Bit of a learning curve for me , not having drink facilitates in the room though. Breakfast is excellent value, I was amazed at the ease that people were served. Busy but relaxed.Im certainly staying here next time im in London.

"So I’m a big fan of Premier Inn’s, including the Hub brand, and use them often for business and personal travel. Just checked into the Westminster Premier Inn Hub on Tothill Street in London. It’s my second or third time here, and I think the location is great, and perfect for my office. However, just checked into room 114 and the air con was throwing a really horrible cheesy feet smell, as well as hot air (and it’s really warm outside). So I go down and mention this to the front desk, and I get told by the lady on duty that she has reset it. I go back to the room and it has made no difference. Still hot air and an awful smell. So I go back down again and this time am curtly asked whether I’ve used anything in the room. When I reply that I have not, I get told I they will get me a new room if I go and get my stuff. So back up I go a third time, get my bags and come and get the key for a new room. No ‘sorry, about that’ from the front desk. So off to my new room I go - and it is right in the back in the basement, in the absolute bowels of the building. The hall carpets looks unhoovered, no mobile signal and really tucked away. All a bit grim. I get these are cheap and cheerful rooms, and good value for central London, but for £130 a night, I do expect a working AC and a modicum of customer service. If you are tempted to use this hotel for business, don’t bother - leave it to the tourists who are willing to put up with more in return for the central location.

"Stayed over three nights in early July - hadn't realised that it was Pride weekend when we booked to attend the Hyde Park concerts but this hotel was reasonably priced and well located so seemed to be worth a punt when the usual suspects were uneconomic.All in, a great stay with a high quality but no frills experience. The ground floor room we stayed in (46) had no window but didn't feel claustrophobic with plenty of well angled lighting and a sense of space with the clean, white decor. The capsule style bed was cozy and plenty big enough for two with clever use of space at the foot end to allow for a desk and plenty of storage below.The air conditioning was very effective, the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate and the quality of sound insulation was better than many London hotels we've previously stayed at.Recommended!",7-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
Compact room at reasonable price in great location. Would recommend for a couple of nights maximum due to the compact space. Very well located near to two underground stations and Westminster.

"Bearing in mind we were in the heart of the city, the hub was really good value for money. It gave us everything we needed for a weekend stay, Clean, fresh and modern.

"As long as you know what you're signing up for in advance and realise the clue is in the name (small rooms) then this is a perfect hotel for a short stay in London. The room features actually put some four and five star hotels to shame.Yes, the rooms are small but if it's just a base for exploring London it's perfect. Check in super smooth, staff are all really friendly and helpful, beds super comfortable, big rain forest showers, air conditioning, big TV, and good storage despite the size of the room.Breakfast is fine for the price and the happy hour cocktails are probably the cheapest you'll find in London.Second Hub we've stayed in and I'll definitely use them again.

"For approx £100 a night for a couple and £6 each for a decent breakfast ( not just continental but bacon / sausage and eggs) great location for that event in London - we went to the royal Albert hall others had been to the concerts in Hyde park or pride Easy electronic check in - rooms small but have all the functionality you need. Brilliant air con, shower also good Bar area was busy and they have a late bar, not expensive compared to other places in the area also free tea and coffee from the machines 3 mins walk from st James / 7 mins from Westminster tubes. Make sure you go to the tothill address there’s another hub in dacre street and we went their in error 1st and queue of people shouting about rooms not readyStaff all welcoming and efficient - would definitely come again Also the perfect set up for a work trip to London - desk pulls out in the room so you can work ",6-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
Needed a comfortable one night stay in London. This was the cheapest we could find in July. Price was right. Great value for money. It was extremely comfortable. Shower big and refreshing. Hairdryer in room. Breakfast great. All staff were more than helpful and very very friendly. Rooms are very small and compact but very well designed providing all you need for a one night stay. Everything here exceeded our expectations.

"We had 2 carry on bags and there wasn't even enough room to open them and this was with the large room. Not even enough room to walk by each other at the end of the bed. I don't know what people with 2 regular sized suitcases would. do. Other than that, the location was great (5-10 minutes from Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben, Churchill's War Rooms, etc), the staff was very friendly, outstanding and willing to do anything to help (couldn't help us with room size, however). Automation in the rooms was cool, with lighting and room temperature controlled on the bed headboard.

"The hotel is very close to the QE11 centre where I was attending an event, and is very convenient for visiting the Abbey or getting into the WestEnd. St James Park tube is a 2 minute walk, Westminster tube is less than 10 minutesI’d recommend paying the small premium and booking a larger room if there are two of you, and packing a couple of extra coat hangers, but the room was incredibly functional and let’s face it, you don’t come to London to sit in your room. The breakfast at £6 is great a value, although the scrambled egg was rather over cooked and dried out, but for I feel I’m being a bit picky at this price.I’ve stayed in other budget hotels in the area but would choose to stay here again if needing a hotel in this part of London.",4-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html

"I stayed with my wife whilst in London to visit Wimbledon. We chose the Hub due to good reviews and due to it being at least 1/3rd cheaper than nearby 4* hotels. Whilst not cheap (£200 per night) I appreciate that London prices, whilst always high, are even worse during Wimbledon fortnight.It was our first stay at a Premier Inn ‘Hub’ hotel and we were impressed given the competitive rate. The room, whilst compact, had ample space for us, was spotlessly clean and had a huge and very comfortable bed. A 100% blackout blind, great sound insulation and efficient air con ensured a great night’s sleep.Breakfast, whilst simple, was fresh and tasty and represented excellent value for money at £6. (I hate paying the c £15-20 that 4-5* hotels want to charge for a simple breakfast).The staff were friendly and welcoming. I’d recommend the Hub Westminster and whilst not quite as ‘cool’ as ‘Citizen M’ hotels the ‘Hub’ is a similar concept and very well executed by Premier Inn.",4-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
"Fantastic location! The room was clean and tidy. Given it's a Hub I expected it to be small and it was (paid for the bigger room upgrade, we had two rooms and one did seem bigger than the other.....). The TV remote was hit and miss which became quite annoying and it was tricky to control the heating. Didn't expect to have to make the bed myself on arrival but perhaps that's par for the course with a premier inn hub. Bed was very comfortable, and the shower was excellent! One of the biggest downsides was the lack of any tea making facilities. If this had been clear when booking, we could have purchased a cheap travel kettle. Free tea and coffee is available but that means trekking downstairs and bringing it back to your room.It's expensive for what it is but then when you consider the location the price is probably just about justified. The breakfast was superb value! By far the biggest plus point is the staff, every member we encountered was professional, courteous and extremely polite and helpful.Knowing what we know now and being able to prepare better we would definitely stay again.

"The hotel is very well positioned in Westminster so was an easy choice when i had a conference nearby. The whole workings are very high-tech but the staff are incredibly warm and friendly so you don't feel like a number. Good value for money and the breakfast is a steal (for London). Rooms are very well apportioned and make the best use of the small space, bed is huge and very comfortable, bathrooms clean and the showers are great! Only thing I'd flag, I had a room with no window, which was okay when i arrived in the evening but found disconcerting in the morning. They do have rooms with windows, so next time I'll request one.",3-Jul-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
"First time staying in a hub, definitely won't be the last. Was very impressed, although the room was small it had everything you needed and more. Extremely clean and easy to check in and out.

"From check in to check out the staff here were fantastic and friendly. The rooms are compact without feeling cramped, and the clever lights and air con controls on the headboard panel is very classy. No tea or coffee in the room but complimentary down in the bar which is a nice touch and a bit more social. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning and for £6 you'll be hard pressed to get better value in central London. Even the 2 4 1 cocktails during happy hour (5-7pm) are very reasonable at £6.50. Overall a very pleasant stay and I would happily recommend a stay here, even for a few nights. oh and the shower was amazing.

"Great Central location. Short walk to places like Westminster Abbey, London Eye, big ben, Leicester Square etc. I have stayed here once previously and have also tried other hotels in London. This will always be the one I stay at from now on. Reasonably priced (well for London anyway). Friendly staff, very clean rooms and a lovely comfortable stay. The only reason I didn't give it a 5* was the kettle situation. I want a cuppa as soon as I wake up in the morning and I don't particularly want to go all the way downstairs through the busy bar to get one. But that's the only negative.

"For to be honest: normally I book cheap hotels and try to get as much as I can for my money. This time this hotel was on Sale and this (and nothing else) was the reason to book it. It was less or more cheap. As we arrived we found it really great then and were surprised what we can get - even in London, where many cheap Hotels offers just a ""hole"" to sleep - for this money. We really liked our stay and the whole package. Can not find much to complain. Maybe just that the room was small... More than 3-4m2 on the side you can not walk... but all together it was a great stay and (if I can get the same rates again) I would definitely book it again.

Nice place to stay if you are after somewhere clean and new. The rooms aren’t large but I’m only in the place to sleep so it’s not a big deal.

"I like to walk, not a fan of busses or “tubes”. This hotel is walking distance from basically everywhere. For those that do, the underground station is less than 100m away. Longest distance in walking time was 35 min and it was to tower bridge. Rooms are a bit on the small side for a person over 6 feet, but the room is comfortable, clean and the space is well used. The price was also better than staying in economy options like apartments. It’s great for people that don’t have small kids because of space, or people that like to stay in the hotel for vacations.

The hub is a really well designed room and as a base for a couple of nights is ideal.we have used a hub for another city break and will definitely use one again. The only problem we had and it's nothing to do with the hub. .The underground station close to the hub hotel was not operating on the weekend due to engineering works.

"Stayed for one night. Plus'sTHE STAFF.Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, was lovely (management take note). We only knew Kiara's name from checking us in but I could have named anyone.LOCATION.Turn right and Westminster Abbey is right there in front of you, about a 3 minute stroll away. St. James Park underground is a 2 minutes walk away, Westminster about 7 minutes. So close to a lot of things but relatively quiet. Within a 15 minute easy stroll, you have Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, St.James Park.....it's great.BREAKFAST. £6 for all you can eat, this knocked spots off 5* London hotels I've stayed in (my reviews have been taken down due to change of ownership - I'm not happy). Great sausages, bagels, cakes, fresh fruit salad (not tinned) bean to cup coffee. It's self service but food was replenished regularly. You normally hear someone complain about something, I didn't hear anyone. NigglesTHE ROOM.It's fine and had 5 plug sockets and what looked like a US socket as well....but the bed is a bit high and you have to climb on to it and is up against a wall on 3 sides. A problem if there are two of you and the one nearest the wall has to visit the bathroom in the night. The wash basin is also high and I could imagine water running down the arms of anyone around 5 foot tall. That said, the bed was comfortable and the shower was fine.The in-house bar was still serving drinks in what was a relaxed atmosphere at 12.30am when we left. There are also a couple of pubs nearby.

"This was the first time we stayed in a HUB and it was amazing. The rooms were bright and cheerful, loved the display panel controls for air con, light, Do Not Disturb sign. Bathroom nice, shower was amazing. Bar area was lovely and relaxing and breakfast was good for the price. Nice relaxed atmosphere with lovely helpful staff. Location was perfect, you could walk to most central parts of London in no time but 2 tube stations on the doorstep as well. It was quiet as well. Good nights sleep had after 2 very busy days.

We stayed at the hub by Premier Inn for 3 days in June. The hotel is in an excellent location just steps away from Westminster Abby and walking distance to Buckingham Palace. The hotel was very clean and modern. We had a larger room and the bed was at least a king size and was big enough for 2. The front desk workers are very helpful and were able to store our bags since we arrived before our room was ready. We would definitely stay here again if in London.,23-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html

"Booked this trip so husband and I could spend few days sightseeing. Location was in the heart of Westminster so we were able to walk to a lot of the places we wanted to visit. Westminster tube was just along the road although we didn't use this and Victoria tube was about 15 minutes walk. Few bars around although get very busy around end of working day. Very near to Westminster Abbey and close to Downing Street. Rooms we're very good. Clean, comfortable and adequate for a vase to stay. Shower gel provided. And good hairdryer. Good full length mirror in bedroom and large one in bathroom Shower powerful. Towels changed and rooms cleaned as required. Also plenty of hangers. Enough for a free days if you double up and although wardrobe is just an enclosure there are 2 hanging rails. We also had bottled water supplies. Room was very modern and touch display for loghts etc. The only negative is that we wanted to use the hub display and control lights from our phone but engineer didn't know why we couldn't work it. It may have been my fault as I'm a technophobe! Overall a very good hotel with friendly staff always wanting to help.

Traveling for business and holiday. This hotel is very conveniently located in central London with all major tourist spots within a walking distance or close to the tube station. Pre-arrival emails were very very useful and the staff checking us in were friendly and helpful. Only slight downside was the coffee and tea amenities are located in the cafe and there’s none in your room. Otherwise very good.

"INCREDIBLE experience in this hotel. Everything was amazing: the location, the friendly staff, the room and service for it's quality/price. I've stayed in this hotel for 17 nights at the end of April - May. Everything worked smoothly since the beggining as I've requested an early check in and a room with a window in advance, and I got all of that without any issue. I've stayed in a bigger room as I thought that the regular room was too small considering that I was there for 3 weeks. First, the location is just perfect as this hotel is at the heart of London: Westminster Abbey is only 1 block away, The Houses of Parliament 3 blocks away, London eye and Trafalgar Square just a couple of minutes walking. The nearest tube station is St James's Park (Circle and District Line), just 1 block away from the hotel, and the Westminster station (Jubilee Line) is about 3 blocks away.About the room, I can see It's exactly how it looks on the pictures posted in this site. It's very well designed, modern and clean. The bed is very confortable and the panel where you can control the lights and temperature is the star of the room. Actually, it's very handy. I've read many comments complaining about the size of the room, and I knew beforehand that it was going to be a small room comparing to other from other hotels, but I never felt it was an issue for me. On top of that, it has a very useful under-bed storage and they provide you with towels and a new duvet every day. Free complimentary water the first day as well. The breakfast it's served on the Lounge and it's very cheao: only 6 pounds! It's a buffet breakfast and it has a lot of options to choose from. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Jorge was super friendly and chatty. Amazing experience. I'm looking forward to go back!!",14-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
"We appreciated the impeccable cleanliness down to the smallest things, including changing the air filters in the rooms, the new set of sheets after three days during our six night stay, the unbeatable value of the £6 breakfast with delicious eggs, sausage, bacon and bread and the complimentary coffee and tea. The breakfast option made a huge difference for us as we were on the last leg of a three week trip and having this option was the most affordable for quality meal we could find anywhere in London - the perfect thing to set the day off right (and didn’t close so early that we could sleep in on some days).Not to mention the location! Half a block from Westminster Abbey and from St James Station, it was so central we could enjoy our trip to the fullest using a 7-day Oyster card. We stayed in one of the new “larger” rooms and the only thing we’d recommend is having a second seating option in the room, having more lighting options to have the bed dark but the lights on full in the toilet (so that one person can sleep while the other showers), having the app available to international App stores for those not from the UK (we’re from Canada) and a very minor thing of having the hand soap pump on the same side of the counter as the sink so that there’s less risk of dripping onto the counter. And having tissue boxes available from the vending machine in the lobby (we had allergies while we were there - not a big deal as we just found some at the local Tesco instead).It was wonderful peace of mind staying in a place that obviously thought about cleanliness and with the room layout also very well thought out. Will definitely look to stay here again! Hope to see this chain expand internationally!",14-Jun-19,Hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d12895922-Reviews-Hub_by_Premier_Inn_London_Westminster_Abbey-London_England.html
Great location for visiting all parts of London as only a couple of minutes from the underground and also Westminster Pier. Friendly and very helpful staff. Really good value breakfast.

"The entire area is full of accommodations for travellers. It appears that some of the hotels share services or such due to the way they are set up. That said, I felt it wasn't as central as I would have liked but given the price of something ""more central"", this was quite alright. It is connected to the Phoenix hotel next door in terms of some services but is not physically connected it seems. This front desk is not open 24 hours and in off hours, the service transfers to the Phoenix Hotel. The room was very clean but there was a very slight smell in the bathroom--probably from the shower curtain that needed to be changed/washed. Otherwise, the rest of the suite was well maintained. I would say that compared to other places I've stayed at, this is only average and is not exceptional. There is wifi, the amenities are available for basic stay, the room is clean and tidy and the area is safe. There is not a breakfast included in this one--which is fine (I'd rather no breakfast than something slapped together). The staff are friendly enough but I still found a bit distant. The areas is lovely so going for a stroll is nice. There is a chance to leave luggage after you check out if your flight is later in the day. If you are looking for boutique-y or more personal, this isn't going to fit... it is a good place to stay and sleep.Would stay again if visiting London.",11-Jul-19,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"The hotel itself is okay, however there are a few things that would not want me to stay there again. The area is not what it used to be, and this is the main reason. A lot of beggars, homeless and unsavoury type characters now are aplenty down nearby Bayswater. The street is dirty and not pleasant to wander. Some of the restaurants also add (non-advertised or advised) service charges to bills without advising, to me indicating that the area has become a real tourist trap. The hotel was okay, but as previously reviewed, there is no lift and the stairs are quite narrow, the rooms and bathrooms are very small and would only suit a couple for 1-2 nights maximum. There is no lounge or bar area in the hotel, but you can go to the sister property next door. The staff are hit and miss, with some okay, and some not so good.",10-Jul-19,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html

"We stayed at Kensington Gardens Hotel for five nights in June 2018. Check-in was easy enough next door at the adjoining hotel. They gave you an actual key (not a key-card) with a room number attached to it. This made it hard to fit in a pocket, but we made it work. Our hotel room was on the top floor, and just like the other reviews, if you have a lot of luggage, it is a lot of work. This was the last leg of a four-leg trip through Europe (where we got engaged!) so we had a lot of heavy luggage that haul up. There is no elevators or assistance for bags, so be prepared. Like a lot of loft-like hotels, there is not HVAC/Air conditioning, instead, there is a fan and a window - just how like it was when I was raised in London! The staff encountered were friendly and were quiet, and the room was immaculately clean. Looked newly renovated and the bed was nice, a little firm, but nice. The room was not too spacious, but that's what you get in most hotels in and around London. The location was perfect for catching the Underground, buses, and the like. Close to shopping, restaurants, and pubs. I would recommend again unless you have a lot of luggage!",20-Nov-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"Being honest I was a bit iffy when booking this hotel. Given that it’s official rating seems to be 2-star, and it’s very competitively priced, I was worried this might be reflected in standards of cleanliness, service etc., but booked it anyway on the basis of the previous reviews. The reviews were accurate and the rating does it no justice whatsoever! The hotel, room and bathroom were all spotless. It was a lovely location, overlooking a very quiet garden square, and very centrally located in terms of tube access. Bayswater (District & Circle) is a 3 or 4 minute stroll, while Queenswater (Central Line) is just a couple of minutes further, and Paddington is maximum a 15 minute walk.We got a lovely welcome from Rosanne (sorry if this is not correct spelling) who could not have been more welcoming or helpful. Reception is staffed until 5pm daily. After 5pm you book in or collect your keys at the next door sister hotel, the Phoenix Hotel. Really amazing value for London. Am already recommending to family & friends!Only caveat: there is no lift, with rooms on first to fourth floors.",24-Sep-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html

"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in July. The price according to the quality isn't justified at all. The only good thing is the location as it's next to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations, both useful.As we arrived, we had a £125 charge in our credit card made by them in order to check the availability of the card without permission or any kind of notification for us to know they were gonna do that.We asked the hotel staff if they charged that amount and at first they told us they didn't, we had to ask twice to two different people to find out it was theirs. For that reason, we had to cancel our credit card immediately as we didn't initially know where that charge came from. That was a very annoying mishap as we were abroad.On the second hand, the room was not as clean as expected, and we were not able to use the kettle they offer on their webpage as it was extremely dirty. Same thing with the air conditioning, both things were a bit nasty.Finally, we were accused to have smoked on the room without any clear evidence of it, which was quite offensive and untrue. I don't want to go on holiday and feel uncomfortable and disgusted and pay £500 for it.",16-Jul-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"Stayed here whilst attending concert in Hyde park. Location could not be faulted, the hotel sits right on the edge of Hyde park. My husband upgraded our room to a suite as I was celebrating a birthday. The room was certainly huge and the view outstanding. I would say that the room needed smartening up a little and one particular point to make is bathroom felt below par with large crack running along wall and some mound in one corner, however on the whole the room was very clean. Housekeeping were quick to respond to requests of additional towels and when we requested a container to transport flowers home that my husband had arranged for the room, they responded immediately. Breakfast is self service and was both plentiful and tasty, with a large selection to choose from. Staff are friendly and helpful. Nice touch was the free minibar and would recommend this hotel for a short stay in London.

"I stayed here for two nights with my sister while in London. It was just ok. It was clean and served it's purpose of being a place to stay. However, the room was incredibly cramped. I am an average sized person and I really struggled to survive with my sister and our suitcases in the space provided. The shower was outside the bathroom and in the bedroom, which was not only bizarre but provided zero privacy. If you're there with a spouse, no problem. But with a sibling or friend, it provides a very awkward situation! There is not 24/7 reception services. When we arrived, we had to check in down the street at the Phoenix Hotel. That wouldn't be too big of an issue except we had to lug our bags with us. You also couldn't enter the building without first dialing reception to let you in...I believe in security, but this added only frustration and was a waste of time every time we wanted to enter the hotel. This hotel needs to get with the modern world and create keys that allow entry on their own. This hotel is also not air conditioned (as many hotels in London aren't). They provided a fan and a window, but opening the window allowed flies in. The window also opened onto an area directly across from another room. So if we wanted fresh air, we had to accept that we wouldn't have any privacy.",25-Jun-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"I booked through hotels.com & based on the generally good reviews about this property there, assumed I was getting value for my money. Reached at 12:30AM on the day of my check-in, having informed the property, they mentioned I would need to pick up the key from their ""sister"" property, which is next door, Phoenix hotel. Was given keys (we'd booked two rooms for two nights) to rooms on the 4th & 5th floor of a non-lift(elevator) building. No recourse available- the receptionist at Phoenix could neither offer a room at a lower floor, or; a room at their hotel(which incidentally features an elevator). I literally lifted my heavy bags on my head & hefted them 5 flights of stairs to reach a room, which can charitably be called a ""coop"", tiny - about 8 ft by 5ft with a bathroom 1/2 this size. Now, None of the reviews on hotels.com had even hinted at this feature of either the room, or; the hotel..which points to a degree of collusion between this stellar agent (hotels.com) & the hotel, in question. So, my recommendation to would-be budget travelers intending to stay at Kensington gardens hotel is to be aware of these aspects which aren't clear",25-Jun-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"Paid £72 for one night without breakfast.Three minute walk from Bayswater Tube Station, many restaurants, Tesco Express and Sainsbury Local for supplies. Hyde Park a short walk away along with Notting Hill and Portabello Market.We arrived at 7.30 pm so collected key from neighbouring Phoenix Hotel. No lift, we were on 3rd floor, not an issue for us but could be for others.Room and en-suite looked newly renovated, nicely presented, clean and tidy. The room was small but large cupboard for storage. Bed was comfortable.Facilities included toiletries, nice fluffy towels, TV, plenty coffee/tea etc.For the price, we thought it was excellent value and would stay again if similar price.",12-Mar-18,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"We spent 1 night at Kensington Gardens Hotel whilst attending Hyde Parks Winter Wonderland. The Hotel is really smart and tidy. The staff could not be anymore helpful, professional or polite. They made us feel really welcome. We had our 10 months old baby with us too. It was a really pleasant 1 1/4 mile walk through Kensington Park into Hyde park. Plenty of Eateries just around the corner from the hotel. The breakfast was served at the sister hotel next door - Phoenix Hotel. Again staff made us very welcome. English breakfast was nice and cooked to order. We would def recommend and also stay here again. Thank you..

"We stayed in a triple room at the Kensington Gardens Hotel and loved it! We walked to the hotel from Paddington Station (about a 15 minute walk). We arrived late morning and were warmly greeted by the host (forgot her name, but she was lovely and very helpful). We were a bit too early for checkin, but she grabbed our bags and locked them in her office so we could start exploring London. When we arrived later in the day, we noticed that she had delivered our bags to our room. The room itself was in the lower level. VERY quiet. Not a huge room, but most certainly large enough for the three of us. There was a large window that looked up to the street level. There were plenty of lights, including nice reading lights by the two beds. The bathroom was compact, but very clean and modern. The location was awesome. Within walking distance of the Bayswater tube station, and there are loads of cafes, restaurants, pubs and shops nearby. We enjoyed a couple nearby pubs, some awesome Indian food, and some of the great nearby shops. A short walk away was Kensington Park, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and more. With three of us, it was actually cheaper for us to use Uber instead of the tube, and it was really easy to get cars in this area. The office at the hotel is open 8a-5p (8a-3p on Sundays). Like most small hotels, they ask you to leave your keys when you are gone. When the office is closed, they run all the keys to their sister property, the Phoenix Hotel, which is a couple doors down. The staff there was great as well - very friendly. This is where there is a bar, and they also serve breakfast here.Overall it was a very enjoyable stay, and we would not hesitate one bit to stay here again.",27-Nov-17,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"My mother and I stayed for one night in a twin bedroom. This hotel is beautiful! It's walking distance from Bayswater underground station and an entire street of resteraunts and shops, and even Hyde Park. The bathroom and room itself were very clean and spacious. We had a lovely view of the square infornt of the hotel from the second floor. We did arrive later so we needed to pick the key up form the sister hotEl but this wasn't a problem at all and the staff were very pleasant. An electronic fan was provided in the wardrobe however we didn't need it as we found it a little cold but once we got into bed we were fine. As the windows are old they did not keep out the noise, we heard nearly everything in the street but again this wasn't a problem because the hotel is along a side street which was quiet enough.I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short or long stay and I will most definitely be staying again.",13-Nov-17,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"This hotel is a great location - walking distance to Kensington Palace and the shops and areas around, as well as two tube stations. It felt like you were in a more residential area, which was nice. Our guess is that it was once apartments, now converted to a hotel. It is affiliated with the Phoenix hotel next door - which means reception is only there 8:00am - 5:00pm Monday to Friday. So you need to stop at the Phoenix Hotel to either drop off or pick up your room key if you are outside those timeframes. This wasn't a bother, we just didn't expect it. Room was standard sizing for Europe and clean. Staff were quite nice! No complaints at all.",21-Oct-17,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html

"Lovely little hotel near Kensington Palace, Notting Hill, etc. as well as the tube. Got there at 9am after a red-eye flight from the US and my room was ready which was a lovely surprise. Woman who checked me in was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint would be that there is no AC or an elevator. Luckily I was there when the evenings were cool. But my luggage was very heavy so carrying it up stairs was difficult.

"I stayed here for 3 nights in February when I was in London for a few days. The hotel is in a great location and close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations which is good for getting around. The area itself is quiet enough and feels very safe even at night. I had room 16, if I remember correctly, which is right beside reception so I didn't have any stairs to climb.The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable and have a kettle, TV and a cosy bed. The wifi was fast enough for me to watch videos on and not have to use my data. The only thing I didn't like was the view from my room which looked out onto another wall of the hotel but this didn't bother me too much as I was there to see the sights, not look out my hotel window. I think the price is very reasonable for what you get, especially for London.

"Close to 2 tubes and walking distance to a number of landmarks, the location is great. The room was clean and comfortable - higher quality than many. Only issue was the noise from neighbouring room and our misfortune of having a heavy snorer who was heavy handed on the tv volume next to us. Maybe a volume limiter on the tv would help.Would stay again.",6-Aug-17,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html

"Stayed 3 nights. Check-in is actually a few doors down at the Phoenix. Room 18 was clean, but down in basement next to the street & completely isolated from the rest of the rooms, which was unnerving. Shower head nozzles were clogged & shot in every direction except the way needed, making the bathroom floor slippery. Location is ok if using the tube, but otherwise prepare to walk a distance to attractions. The best attraction is Prince Albert monument near Kensington Palace.

"Chose this hotel very carefully after reading the good reviews on here. When we arrived the hotel was beautiful very appealing lovely staff and all seemed well. However was told at check in we'd been moved next door to their sister hotel which on impressions of the reception thought ok fine. We couldn't see the room as was too early but they assured us our bags etc would be moved there and all would be well. We were in London to see take that at the 02 .. we got back to the ""sister"" hotel at 1 in the morning to be shown to a very outdated shabby room with our cases missing ! Guy on reception was very nice and showed us more rooms but to be fair they were all shabby and not like the images we had based our booking on. We were very disappointed this was a treat for my friends 50th birthday and I felt very let down and annoyed this wasn't what I had booked. The positives though were the staff were very professional and nice but the overall stay was spoilt . I would be very careful if you book this place that they take your booking and mislead you by moving you next door.

"When in London, we use to go to nearby Phoenix hotel; this time it was full, so we choose its ""sister"" hotel. And must say that the choice was very good. The hotel looks recently renovated, and the room we had, on the top of the building, was probably the most spacious I ever had in central London, same with the bathroom; very nice decor, beautiful view on the square, in the room there is also a fireplace, to make a better ambience. Very comfy beds. There is no elevator in the hotel, so you gotta climb a bit, but was not a problem at all. The only improvement I could see was the water flow of the shower, and wifi was not regular all the time.The ladies at reception extremely nice and helpful, very good staff at both Kensington Gardens and Phoenix (in the evening the Phoenix reception works for K.G. guests, too). In a nutshell, a recommendable hotel at a reasonable price, in a very nice, central area. Would certainly return.",23-May-17,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html

Seems a safe area. clean & comfortable stay for a 2 star hotel. bring your own toothbrush etc. cons.1.staircase not easy for elderly.2.wooden floor (though carpeted) but still not good sound proof ... I guess is not avoidable due to building structure. luckily during my stay upstairs is good. but door closing carelessly and TV may still hv sound pass through. May be a concern for those with good ears.3. no reception during night time, need go to next door Phoniex hotel for assistance.

"Nicely located near two tube stations, Bayswater and Queensway. Spotless clean, recently refurbished, very nice service and kind people. I stayed in apt. number 10 which is a small single with shower in suite. There are some perks: clean towels, new soap bars, shampoos and conditioner every day. Also the kettle and hair dryer work fine and they supply some biscuits, tea and cocoa powder so you can have a snack if you in a hurry. Only downsides are there is no lift and no 24h concierge, so you have to leave your keys in the lobby of the next door hotel (Phoenix). It is not a big problem, but when you are tired and with packaging it can be a bit of a burden.

"The hotel is located in a flat in a wonderful part of London. The hotel is close to the action of downtown but also slightly removed. It is on a quiet, tree lined street. It is very close to two tube stations. It was about 20-30 minutes to Tottenham Court Rd and Covent Garden on the tube. I don't recommend taking a taxi or uber from downtown to the hotel as the traffic makes the price too high. The only downside is the room is very small but we expected that coming into the hotel.

"The greeting on arrival at this hotel was one of the friendliest I've experienced! It's small, quiet and very clean. As previous reviewers have mentioned it's the sister hotel of The Phoenix next door, and after 5pm you pick up your key and gain entry etc via their desk. This arrangement sounded like a bit of a faff, but actually everyone was so friendly and helpful I didn't mind (and a late night phone call to my room was successfully transferred via The Phoenix's front desk). The room was comfortable, warm and clean, with a nice soft bed and good bedding. It was very small but the bathroom was nearly the same size! Shower was excellent. It's on a quiet residential road, but there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, plus it's only a few minutes' walk to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations.

"My friend and I stayed at Kensington Gardens Hotel for 5 nights in the middle of July, and we loved it. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. As it is the sister hotel to Phoenix Hotel (literally right next next door) you do have to go to Phoenix for breakfast (which was like any other hotel breakfast, you could get continental or hot cooked food) but there is so many restaurants and pubs that do English breakfasts that you can choose from on the main street just down the road from the hotel. You also have to leave your keys with the reception staff when you leave and if you get back to the hotel after 5pm be aware that you do have to collect the keys from Phoenix hotel! Also there is no elevator and some may find the stairs to be steep, so if you have many or heavy bags you might want to ask for a lower floor. The rooms were clean (looked recently refurbished) and looked just like the pictures provided by the hotel. We stayed in a room with two single beds with two large suitcases and found that was more than enough room considering we were really only in the room to sleep anyway! There was no aircon or ceiling fan, but we found that if we had the small fan (found in the closet) and opened a window the temperature was perfectly fine (although we are from Australia so we are used to extremely hot weather!). There's free wifi too which was more than adequate for us to use simply for basic internet browsing and uploading some pictures to facebook.Great location too, a short walk from Bayswater station made it easy to navigate around London; short walk to many restaurants and pubs; and obviously a short walk from Kensington Gardens which was amazing. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!",30-Sep-16,Kensington Gardens Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195311-Reviews-Kensington_Gardens_Hotel-London_England.html
"I really wanted to like this hotel... From the 3 flights of stairs (no elevators, and keep in mind in much of Europe it's ground floor then first floor); no AC (ok, I get it, it's UK); to the parties neighborhood kids have until 3am; it's hard not to complain. When I arrived via Bayswater station (quick and easy to get to the hotel), there was no reception. Another traveler had to tell me to go next door to the Phoenix Hotel to check in. That was odd, but I'm flexible and have seen this before. I got my keys and went back next door. ""Ok, three flights. How bad can it be?"" I'm in decent shape, but after a day of flying, I was huffing and puffing when approaching my room with my heavy carry-on and backpack (I'm on business). It was hot inside (rare to get high 80F sort of weather in London). Good thing I found a fan in the closet. The windows were ajar and fixed to open a certain size for safety. I had really a great view of the garden and the neighborhood building. Quaint and cute. I loved the neighborhood and I feel it really expresses what London is about what the cultural mix. I've been trying to stay fit while in travels so I found an awesome organic supermarket down the street. I needed some meat, so I dropped by a Lebanese restaurant for some chicken taouk (try it). That was my sans carbs dinner. It was perfect to walk more through the area and explore the local scene. By 9pm I was ready to crash and get a good night's rest flying in from SFO via Copenhagen. It was a long day and I needed to get a lot done the next day around town. It's ironic that right when I turned out the lights, kids and their bumpin' cars kept coming and going. Lots of laughter and showing off their stereo system.... Until 3am. I couldn't exactly close my windows bc it's be too stuffy (remember, no AC) and what could the hotel staff do for street clamor? (Sad face)I did not get much rest. The saving grace was that I was able to find some awesome empanadas and a great latte down the street for breakfast. In the future, I wouldn't mind staying in the area again, but not this hotel. Sorry... A good night's sleep Trumps charm.

This is a centrally located hotel close to the tube and major museums. However our room which contained a double bed should have been a single room. The bed was jammed up against the wall and no bedside tables on either side as there was no room. The hotel did offer to change the room but when booking just be aware that some rooms are very small for two people. With my arms outstretched and holding my iPad in one hand I could touch both walls! Otherwise all good. Staff friendly and helpful.

"I stayed 2 nights at the end of May.I arrived early as I came into London on a night flight. I couldn't get a room until noon so I just sat in the lounge until it was ready. Otherwise I was happy with my accommodation. It was a small but clean, comfortable room and surprisingly quiet. I didn't really fancy sharing a bathroom but I knew when I booked, that the single budget room wasn't an ensuite. I would pay the extra for an ensuite if I had been staying longer. Staff were pleasant and helpful. I would stay again if in London.",12-Jul-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"This hotel was very quaint and the location made it well worth it. Aneel and Eliana at the front desk were exceptional and helpful, the other staff were also very friendly.Our room consisted of 2 twin beds and one full bed, the room itself wasn’t big, but it suited our needs namely sleeping. The bathroom was small but we made it work. The big downside for me was getting into the tub. It was high and I am short, but again I made it work. In the bath room they had the shampoo/conditioner, body wash, hand cream and hand soap.There was no coffee maker but there was electric pot to boil water as there was instant coffee and tea, a small refrigerator but no microwave. The room also had an ironing board, iron and hair dryer.The lobby was nice and there was a small bar and there was an on site Indian restaurant, Light of India. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Indian food. Only other downside was the elevator (lift) was very, very small. As for location the was the best. The subway (tube) station was caddy corner to the hotel. Down the street there were many restaurants. KFC, Burger King, a Lebanese restaurant, Nandos Chicken (amazing), Starbucks, etc. Overall, we were very happy with this hotel and would truly recommend it.

2 night stay due to an event at the Royal Albert Hall. Easy walking distance from the Royal Albert Hall. On the door step of the Gloucester Rd tube. Staff are excellent friendly and efficient. Room was on 2nd floor had aircon and a window that opened. Good size room with tea and coffee facilities. Good breakfast included don't bother with the extra options. ,30-Jun-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"We had the pleasure of recently staying 4 nights at the Montana and recommend it to anyone visiting London for the touristy stuff.The hotel is a 3 minute walk to the Gloucester Tube stop that can get you anywhere in London with ease. There are enough nearby pubs and restaurants for dinners and the hotel breakfasts are very good. By the way, the onsite restaurant serves delicious Indian food in the evenings; don't rule it out just because it is in the hotel.The hotel itself has the typical small lobby bar perfect for a drink at the end of an afternoon or evening. The rooms are tight but charming with nice linens and comfortable beds, and every employee was friendly and helpful. A gem in this class of hotel, a great value, and I would return on my next London visit.",27-Jun-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"We arrived about 2pm on a Monday. As everything had been paid in advance, check in took a matter of minutes. We were given a room in the basement, accessible via stairs off the bar. The room had two twin beds, a desk and bureau, small refrigerator, closet, TV, and a bathroom with full bathtub and shower and large medical cabinet. It was incredibly spacious by London standards. Of course, not all was glorious: the room was very warm and humid even with air conditioning cranked as low as it could go, and our window view looked upon a nasty-looking cement drainage basin between buildings. I kept the curtains closed. A minor issue, all considered, but worth noting.The room was nice and quiet. Few rooms were along that hallway so there was little foot traffic, and no street traffic near us at all. I actually slept pretty well.Everything in the bathroom worked without issue. We loved having a fridge in our room--there's a great Waitrose right across the nearest intersection, which made it easy to stash food and drinks in our room! The front desk staff was very pleasant whenever we passed through. Room service did a good job whenever they came by each day.The breakfast buffet was included with our room package. The best way to describe it is ""meh,"" as it largely consisted of generic, made-long-in-advance foods like you'd find at a cheap motel chain breakfast buffet in the US. The only stand-out was the strawberries, which were fresh and fantastic. The staff there was nice and eager to help, but the mediocre food just didn't make it worthwhile to utilize again.The hotel's location is absolutely fantastic. It's just across the street from the Gloucester Road tube station. This was an easy connection point into the city, and on the direct Piccadilly line to Heathrow. Within walking distance are numerous restaurants of various ethnicities and price points, plus several great museums. We enjoyed the short walk up to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. The neighborhood felt very safe.",26-Jun-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"Good, clean, basic room with excellent front desk staff and location. Stayed three nights recently. You will get a basic room in a converted townhouse. Since it is not a purpose-built hotel, it has its design quirks. For the price I did not expect luxury accommodations. The room was clean and served the purpose. What really was important was the location. You can practically see the hotel from the Gloucester Road tube station entrance (on the Piccadilly line with direct access from Heathrow) and that is a major plus from my perspective when traveling with luggage -- no taxi necessary. Finally, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with what seemed like a genuine interest in helping me and my family enjoy our stay in London -- another major plus in this price range. Would stay here again.",23-Jun-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"Stayed at this great Hotel for 5 days in May 2019. Fabulous Location in Kensington. The Hotel is a 3 minute walk to Gloucester Road Metro, which is on the Piccadilly Line which is a direct line from Heathrow Airport. Very Convenient !!! Bus stop 3 minutes walk away which will take you to a miriad of locations if you prefer overground transport. Excellent eateries in immediate area including Pret A Menger, Starbucks, and 2 great English Pubs. We did not eat in the Hotel Restaurant as we do not do ‘big English breakfasts’ and even though the dinner menu looked very interesting it was Indian cuisine which is not to our taste. The room was excellent. As with most accommodation in London the room was not oversized however it had everything you need. Most importantly for us it had a fridge, safe, tea making and very good WiFi and room to store our luggage. Very clean room and fabulous reception staff. The Hotel did have a LIFT - small but an absolute must for us. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5-Jun-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"I stayed at this hotel twice last year, in July and again in October. The second time, the receptionists recognised me, which was really amazing, seeing they have so many customers. I was recognised again when I stayed with them a few weeks ago. Not only that, but they upgraded me from a room with a shared bathroom to one with en suite. In addition, at first, both in October last year and this again year, they didn't think they had two rooms available for me and the other member of my party for the full time I wanted to stay, but they juggled things around so that we were able to stay there for the whole time (five nights last October, four nights in May.) I can't fault the service, the comfort of the beds, the cleanliness of the hotel, and. of course, the location, which is wonderful. I was given a great deal with the price, better than my travel agent was able to get, perhaps because I rang the hotel direct, I'm not sure, All in all, a great place to stay.",31-May-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"Lovely little hotel, fantastic location to the tube, hop on hop off tour busses, easy to Heathrow via the tube, very friendly staff, lots if neat little restaurants and pubs nearby.

"This hotel has to have the best staff in London. Helpful, courteous, friendly, they are amazing. Rooms were spacious for London, clean, and the hotel is very close to the Big London Museums. It is also close to Gloucester Road underground, so exploring other areas of London is very easy. One of the London tourist (hop on, hop off) busses stop right outside. Very nice Indian restaurant attached where residents receive a discount, and a nice small bar area where again, residents receive a discount.",27-May-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
Really rather dated (white gloss paint that's lost its whiteness) and really not good enough for the price. Got that unmistakable stale hotel smell. Staff polite.

A smaller hotel without the extras like a pool...but this is made up for by the Staff. Super helpful & went to great lengths to make us feel at home. Kampus & Iliana were so helpful & personable with great travel tips & tips on everything London! Absolutely will stay at this place again!,9-May-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"We spent four nights in April here and were extremely pleased with the hotel. Decorated in deep reds and gold, and with crystal lighting fixtures and deep mouldings in common spaces, the hotel has a charming, old world vibe. We asked for a quiet room and were delighted with a spacious family room at the back of the hotel - no view, but then we were in the room only to rest and sleep and the quiet room afforded that! As the building is older, rooms do vary considerably, so contact the hotel directly if you have specific requirements or needs. We were well satisfied with cleanliness. We loved the free loaner phone, which allowed us to navigate London streets without draining the battery on our personal mobiles. Staff was uniformly helpful and friendly, but a special call-out goes to Iliana who set the bar high for exceptional customer service! Our room had adequate television, a nice kettle with coffee and tea service, a small mini fridge (great for families!), a table with chairs, and a safe in the armoire. We used the 15% discount in the Indian restaurant on the premises and thought the meal good. Breakfast was probably the only dent in the stay. It was perfectly adequate, but there is an upcharge of £2 per person for full English. I asked if I could pay the charge and get just eggs with continental toast, fruit, and yogurt and was told no. Quality of the continental spread was average. The hotel is just a minute from the tube, a Waitrose grocery store, and the wonderful French bakery chain Paul, and there are many restaurant options nearby. It’s a ten minute walk max to V&A and not much longer to Kensington Gardens and Prince Albert Hall. If coming from Heathrow, you can stay on the Piccadilly tube line the entire way. All in all, we felt this hotel has the best location of anywhere we’ve ever stayed in London. We’ll be back!",1-May-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"The location was perfect - in a great, safe neighboorhood with things to do right there and a tube stop right one block away. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. The restaurant (with 15% discount) was fantastic. London prices being high generally, I think the cost for staying here was reasonable.",28-Apr-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

We were not staying at this Hotel but had a fantastic breakfast.The staff were so welcoming particularly Fahid so much so on our next visit to London the Montana would be our choice of Hotel.

"For the past 20 years, I have been staying at the Montana Hotel whenever my travels take me to London. The facilities are clean and of a great standard, the staff are always extremely accommodating and do everything in their power to assist guests to make their stay enjoyable. On my most recent stay, I arrived at the hotel in the early hours of the morning, coming straight from a very long flight from Australia, feeling very tired and in need of a shower. They were kind enough to allow me to have a shower while I waited for my room to become available. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, along with grocery stores, a travel information centre across the street, laundry facilities just down the road and the Gloucester Road tube station less than two minutes from the hotel. I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",15-Apr-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"We arrived early in Saturday morning and the hotel were happy to look after our bags as rooms weren't ready. They organised tickets for the Original Bus Tour which the stop was literally outside the hotel. The tube station is a stones throw away from the hotel too. Plenty of cafes, restaurants, supermarkets with within walking distance also. When we got back to hotel out rooms had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. It was a little bit noise as our room was facing the street but I'm not a great sleeper in hotels. The hotel offered breakfast but we chose to go to a cafe down the street. The hotel bar and lobby is lovely and quaint. Not too big and has a small bar. We ate in the hotels Indian restaurant which was really lovely and would definitely recommend it. In the rooms was a phone which you could take out with around London and you could find places to visit, book tickets, restaurants cafes etc. It's a great idea but unfortunately nobody told us about it and it wasn't until the last day that we discovered this. The staff in the hotel were extremely friendly, welcoming and very easy to deal with. Very attentive and i would definitely be back again to stay as would most of the party in the group.",4-Apr-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"Clean, comfortable room with great amenities and all an easy stroll to Kensington Palace, Exhibition Road (museums!!) and the Royal Albert Hall. The Gloucester Road underground station is right across the road, so getting around town is a breeze. The staff at the hotel and in the restaurant (delicious food!) therein were fantastic. I ended up cancelling another booking elsewhere in London so I could return here after a trip out of the UK. Great value...will definitely make this my ""base"" again when I return to London.",30-Mar-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"Easily missed from the road, the moment you walk in the doors you are greeted with a style and class that speaks of yesteryear. Gold silk wallpaper paired with rich red upholstery and beautiful cut glass chandaliers, the hotel is beautifully appointed inside and out. We were greeted at the desk by Aneel who was incredibly helpful in arranging a street view and offering discounts at the lovely house bar and first class indian restaurant (treat yourself you won't regret it).The hotel even handled large tour groups with ease. The room is beautiful, large and spacious with a great bathroom, nice big TV and a great view of the historic church just across the road. Breakfast here is amazing with a lovely continental range and bacon and eggs on offer. The hotel is right near the underground and only a couple of minutes from supermarkets, and lovely cafe's and event the tour buses. 10 out of 10 would easily stay here again and recommend for any who want to stay in inner London.",28-Mar-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html
"The hotel staff were warm and very welcoming. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and efficient. We didn't have breakfast but we did dine in the restaurant on our second night and the food was amazing!. The location of this hotel is fantastic for pretty much everything. Thete are lots of restaurants around the hotel to suit any taste. The Museums are a short five minute walk, the tube station is literally across the road. Given the location and comfort level of this hotel the rates are more than reasonable.

"It started the moment I walked in. Maria was warm and welcoming. My single room was small, clean, comfortable, quiet, and well designed. My shared bathroom was spacious and clean. The breakfast was good. The buffet was a little difficult to negotiate due to my diabetes. Gosia, Justyna, and Natalia helped me with some other choices. Wonderful focus on the customer.The location is perfect!

"I stayed in November last year for a short business trip, the staff were very helpful and spent time with me looking at food options. The room was very clean and tidy with everything that I needed, unlike some other very expensive hotels! I found a good parking option at the Holiday Inn locally through ParkBee.com, everything I needed was within walking distance or a short Hackney ride (wouldn’t touch Uber with a barge pole!).

"We stayed here one night and that was too long. On first looks the hotel was in a good location near restaurants and museums, the big bus tour just down the road, but if you want a good night's sleep I would avoid, the traffic at the front of the hotel at night I could cope with but the paper thin walls were awful, we could hear everything the family next door were doing and saying from having a bath to going to toilet.",1-Mar-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

We knew it to be a great location for the Underground (Gloucester Road 3 min walk) We also knew the Montana Hotel was within 10 min walk of the Natural History Museum (Get there early! It can get claustrophobic. The V & A was a wonder of the modern world and its contents filled with wonders of the ancient world.The Hotel lived up to its website, images.

"My wife and I have just returned from a one night stay at this hotel whilst in London to see the Cirque Du Soliel at the Albert Hall on the 22nd of January. On arriving at the hotel we were made to feel welcome immediately. The gentleman at reception was extremely courteous, helpful and professional.He took our luggage to our room which was greatly appreciated and then proceeded to give us all the information about our room, the hotel and the surrounding area; he could not have been more friendly. The level of service provided by him and all other staff during our stay was excellent.Our room was on the ground floor just behind reception and we were completely satisfied with it, It was cosy and spotless and suited all our needs. There was a small refrigerator for our use, tea and coffee making facilities, television and a courtesy smart phone for free calls if needed during the stay. Maps of London and places of interest were also provided. The shower room was small but perfectly adequate and spotless. Plenty of white towels were provided. The room contained a double bed and a single bed (we obviously only needed the double bed which was comfortable) and had enough space for our needs. There was plenty of drawer space and clothes hanging space. We did not have an evening meal at the adjoining restaurant but did have the continental breakfast the following morning which was perfectly adequate. The staff at breakfast were attentive, friendly and efficient. Our morning toast was brought to us and our coffee topped up regularly. The staff really should be congratulated on the level of service they provided. The Montana really should be proud of the level of service provided during our stay. The location of the Montana is excellent. Close by is Gloucester Road tube station) literally you cross two roads and you are there) and there are also bus stops even closer. There are plenty of shops, cafes etc., close by. We would definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to London if rooms are available; it exceeded our expectations and for that we would like to thank all staff at the Montana for making our stay a memorable one.",24-Jan-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

"The Montana Hotel was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of London. We walked up from Gloucester tube station and the hotel is literally a 2 minute walk across the street. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable concierge that shared with us all we needed to know to make our stay enjoyable. The lobby is a comfortable, old world space lovely for chatting or enjoying a cocktail. The location is wonderful and within reasonable walking distance to V & A Museum, Harrod's and HTB, just to name a few. So many excellent restaurants, patisseries, coffee houses, shops plus the easy access to the tube made our stay most memorable. We had one ground floor room and one on the top floor. Both were cozy and comfortable with everything one would need such as hairdryer; coffee/tea service; mini frig; TV and best of all a mobile phone for use while a guest at the hotel! The ability to have a city map, gps and to make local and international calls for no charge was fantastic! The Light of India restaurant in the hotel was some of the best Indian food I have had-and you receive a discount as a hotel guest! Our waiter Anan was superb as was the food. There is an extensive wine and cocktail list to choose from as well. Overall I feel the Montana Hotel is an excellent choice and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",19-Jan-19,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

"Found the Montana Hotel after a desperate search on booking.com to find a moderately priced room in Kensington with air condition during the massive heatwave seen at the end of June. I booked a classic double room for one night. I arrived early and was able to check-in thanks due the friendly, helpful staff. After finishing my day hiking the Cliffs of Dover, it was so refreshing to return to a room with air condition!!! Would have extended my stay an extra night at the Montana Hotel, but they were fully booked. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for those looking for a moderately priced hotel in the Kensington area. It was very convenient for the Tube, shops, restaurants, and pubs.",29-Nov-18,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

"Stayed with my daughter and my grand-daughter, who was anxious to visit the nearby Natural History Museum.The open-topped bus and red bus stop was just outside the hotel. The tube station is just metres away so it was perfect for visiting all of London. Hotel has a restaurant and there are several other restaurants, cafes and shops nearby, including a well known chain next door for kids who love pizza/pasta!Staff were really helpful and very friendly. They looked after our bags before/after stay so that we could still continue sight-seeing and they arranged our transfer when we left.The room was clean and tidy. It had a TV and a fridge and tea/coffee-making facilities - complimentary mineral water would have been nice. The free wi-fi was good but we only used it for basics and there was a smart phone that you could borrow. We didn't have a big room but was fine for a short stay and it had three beds so we didn't need to share. Our room was at the front and had some traffic noise but the hotel is on a busy road so we expected that. Beds were comfortable (strange to go back to blankets - not as comfy as a duvet) and there were spare pillows, etc. There was a simple selection of toiletries in the bathroom but we used our own and there were plenty of clean, white, fluffy towels. We had an ironing board but there wasn't a lot of hanging space in the wardrobe because of the ""extras"" stored there. As it was a mid-priced hotel, we thought it was good value for money, not luxury but a comfortable room.Breakfast was a good continental and you could opt for a ""full English"" if you wanted. There were lots of staff to make service quick and easy. Staff brought toast and hot drinks and you could help yourself to the food. Being picky, Croissants could have been the fresh, flaky ones from a bakery (or the kitchen) but were OK and there was plenty of other choice so no complaints. Staff were very attentive to my grand-daughter, too. (I do miss marmite in many hotels - love it on toast!)We felt safe and happy staying at this clean and comfortable hotel. That was all that we needed for this particular trip so would happily recommend the Montana to other visitors.",27-Oct-18,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

"I have been travelling extensively for the last few years and have stayed in both pricey and budget hotels. The service rendered by Montana South Kensington was amazing. The bed was super comfy and the room (309) and bathroom were clean. They even provide a free data iphone for tourists staying here. The underground Gloucester Road station is practically across the road so this is very convenient. The receptionists are well-trained and polite. I was particularly impressed with the Italian lady at the front counter that helped me with a printing document. These are services that will make guests feel valuable and pleasant that sadly most hotels these days are lacking. Despite Montana labelled themself as a 3 star budget, this Indian-inspired hotel is a worthy 4 star in my books. My only regret is i did not stay longer. If you don’t stay here, it is your loss!

"The Gloucester Road tube station is just across the street, giving access to the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines. You can get anywhere in London from here! The neighborhood is safe to walk after dark with children, and there are numerous restaurants within easy walking distance. I recommend Pizza Express next door, and Raison d’Etra which is just a 5-8 minute easy walk away. Our room was on the top floor, so we appreciated the lift. The lift is tiny, so our party of 4 with luggage took 4 trips! The room was elegant and comfortable. Obviously updated and well maintained. The en suite was small but excellent quality. There is another full toilet and shower just down the hall, if a 2nd person in your room is in urgent need of the toilet! That one has a window, which is much appreciated. Leave your key at reception when leaving for the day’s adventuring. I’m a knitter, so I left small handmade gifts for the service staff along with the usual gratuity. I would definitely return here.",2-Aug-18,Montana Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html

I felt comfortable and at ease with the room accommodations and the people who work here.I have worked around commercial properties my entire career and though I would love to see a ""cosmetic refresh"" at the Montana, at the same time, I appreciate the Victorian vibe. The service, whenever I needed anything at all, was instantaneous. It is very clean and well maintained and the location is unbeatable. If you want your trip to provide convenience to stores and restaurants, walking distance to landmarks like Kensington Palace and world class museums, as well as the Gloucester Rd Underground to well, everywhere, this is it.

"When we arrived, our check in was delayed due to suite not being ready. The staff gave a voucher for drinks from the restaurant which was appreciated. The suite was of good size. Unfortunately, the shower had see through glass walls and anyone else in the room could see the person in shower which made it very difficult for us considering the age of our children. When we raised it with the hotel, we were initially advised that there is a button to make the shower walls opaque. There was no button and the hotel receptionist could not find either. Then we were told that the shower was made just like that. This meant that all the family had to move out of the room when one member was having shower. We requested for change of suite. The receptionist told it will be done but then we never heard back from them. We managed somehow although we could not understand the pathetic planning and purpose behind the showers. The buffet breakfast was good. ",13-Jul-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

Excellent location by the docks, 5 min walk to DLR station to take you into town. Also 1 minute to the Sunborn Yacht Hotel where we had a superb afternoon tea.

I came back from a walk at 1500, and my room had not been done, strange thing. I called reception and informed the young man there, told him I need to rest, so not to send anyone until after 1800. Twenty minutes later a couple of lady's came to do the room. I told them ""after 1800"". At 1745 I left, and came back at 2230, only to find a bag with towels by my door, and the room had not been touched!

"Looking for somewhere to stay near London airport give this one a miss unless you like to be ignored and like mouldy bathrooms.No point in being a gold loyalty member as the rewards are rarely available and then only when complaints are made.Was given a free drink voucher and told I could order any drink but at the bar an told no this is not the case as the offer us for only some drinks.Then waited in the restaurant with no menu offered, I had to ask. Then had to ask to order. Restaurant was not busy and at least 4 staff where chatting at the bar. Burger was very good. Had to ask again for the menu for dessert. the brownie for dessert was just a piece of stale, dry chocolate cake. Had to ask for the bill Not once was I asked if I would like anything.Requested a wake up call as I had any early flight. That never came.There is no conceriege to speak to as it is all virtual.

"Stayed her the night for while at an exhibition at Excel.Perfectly placed fro Excel. bed was comfortable and the room showed a recent refurb. The shower was good but the controls fro overhead and handheld would benefit from being clearer.Breakfast had an excellent choice and the only gripe was that the hot food could have been hotter, the eggs were not so and therefore the meal lost its gloss, otherwise nothing bad to say.

"I stayed here for 3 nights last week as I had business at the Excel. Just a couple of minutes walk from the Excel its probably the nearest hotel to the exhibition centre so ideal location. I was really impressed with this hotel, the rooms were really large for London standards, housekeeping were excellent and I loved the large bathroom and huge shower (pleased to see you could frost out the glass screen!). My room was very warm and I found the air con unit a little lack lustre, and you can't open the windows. I also found it a bit stingy that they charge for bottled water in the rooms. Breakfast was excellent, plentiful and lots of choice and food in the evening was great, although the restaurant was closed every night of my stay so you could only eat in the bar, which was fine. I would say the wines on the menu are overpriced. The staff were without exception friendly and well trained.

"First the good points- Best location for the Excel center,within easy walking distance. The room size was excellent , very clean and the beds firm for comfortable. the front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. The bad points - ate at the restaurant both for breakfast and once for dinner. Breakfasts were not hot to start and went cold very fast. the dinner- service was dreadfully slow and the brought the wrong food out even though we pointed out on the very small menu exactly what we wanted as the description bad - 'vurger' for the vegan burger. Because both meals were brought out at same time one of us had to eat our meal alone or let it go cold whilst waiting for the correct meal to be brought for the other. We were offered no compensation for the mistake. The main issue in the room we had was the air cooling system. it did nothing but circulate the warm air in the room. Opening the window meant the noise from the outside was loud and the window wouldnt close properly without alot of force.",30-May-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html
"Unfortunately, I have had a bad experience at your Novotel in the Royal Victoria Dock.Ok, so before checking in, I called yourselves about my dietary requirements. I was informed by the person who answered the call after checking that you do provide halal chicken. I said to the gentleman on the phone, that if he could ring me back to DOUBLECHECK, that would be great. He replied that he would and took down my details. The next day, he called me and informed me that your hotel does provide Halal chicken, All of the chicken on ALL of the dishes that you serve is halal. So I was pleased to hear this.So on the 23rd, I came to check-in unfortunately I was unable to check in due to the pin on my card being entered incorrect. So I tried it 3 times and unfortunately it got blocked and declined. In the end my room was booked. however, I asked your reception staff whether I can still use the card in the bar or restaurant before I went to my room, he replied to me, that I would be able to use the card, because its using a different card reader/terminal station. (I didn't know what he meant by terminal station, so I apprehensively said 'oh..ok.'.I went to order a drink, believing what he said, and no surprise, the card got declined. So due to your colleague lying to me, I looked like a right idiot buying a drink and not being able to pay for it! So that really annoyed me.So after this I went to my room and OMG!! I was so disappointed in the quality of the room. it was soo small, very standard, had a horrible odour to it and the bath and showers looked like it was put in 40 years ago! The bed sheet had some marks on the bed, god knows what they were. I felt really uncomfortable and in the end I slept on the sofa bed. So a few things to complain about, but that wasn't the worst....I went to the restaurant later to get some dinner with my colleagues. I was keen to get some lovely chicken to eat. I was even saying to my colleagues that this restaurant is nice to cater to Muslims, especially in Ramadan (the time of month for fasting, 20 hours a day!) for his needs. So you had some great compliments coming from me, despite there was wrong information provided to me and the poor was is some serious low standards and poor hygiene. So the waiter came and asked me what me and my colleagues wanted to order, I ordered a salmon starter and a dish with chicken. At this point I thought I would DOUBLECHECK again. (This is the 3rd time I have checked at this point) Surprisingly, the waiter says, 'no sir, the chicken is not halal', I was confused, because I double checked this previously and told them, no you double check, i called the hotel a few days ago and they do provide halal chicken for ALL DISHES containing chicken. He went and checked in the kitchen and they told him, no only chicken on the pizza. this information was relayed back to me. I was confused.. I had checked with someone, they said its halal, I told them to doublecheck and call me back, he did and STILL said it is halal for ALL CHICKEN. I was soo annoyed with this. But I was with colleagues and I thought I would tell the general manager there and then, but I thought, no its ok. Order something else, something vegetarian. So I told the waiter, 'Ok, Since the chicken is not halal, could I have a vegan burger, he confirmed this and later on..he bought me a beef burger with BACON!! Now, not only is this order wrong, but he brought me some meat which is not halal, but he bought me a burger with bacon. I am not sure if you are aware of Muslims and the importance of avoiding pork. This piece of bacon was put right in front of me, whist I was about to break my fast. I couldn't believe the staff getting the order soo wrong and offended me soo much. You might as well have bought me coke and put wine in its place!! So all in all, a horrible and terrible experience with Novatel.What is your company going to do about this?Dishonest and not loyal, poor communication with colleagues, what happened to me could happen to anyone else.",29-May-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

"To whom it may concern, I am staying at Novotel in London. This is my worst experience with the brand of Novotel, as I am a regular traveller and a member of the Accorhotels. I want to draw your attention to the following 3 mismanagement things:1. Staff at the check-in desk both dishonest and deceiving2. Breakfast experience is just awkward!3. random people in the hotelAt the check-in I asked to give me a particular room, and the member of staff confirmed the room will be as asked. Upon arrival to the room I found that its completely different to what was asked and then promised. Breakfast. I book it hoping that I would experience the best service and breakfast. In fact - it was worse than in the Holiday inn. There was only eggs and bacon. All the rest was either close to its expiration or distasteful. And no service at ALL!

We chose the Novotel as it was close to the Emirates Cable Car Line which was the start of a whirlwind tour of London followed by the Thames Clipper down to The London Eye.The reception is large and immpressive, we had checked in online so the process took a couple of minutes. The children loved the foot massages at the bottom of the lifts.The bar was well stocked and had skysports. There was a good selection of bar meals to choose from, we had the pizzas, which were very tasty.The beds were comfortable and our youngest child (9) said she slept well on the sofa bed.The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choise and had views over the Thames Royal Dock, giving a great start to the day ahead.

Firstly this hotel is pet friendly at an extra cost. The rooms are nice spacious enough with all mod cons. We booked this at the last minute as we hadn’t planned to be in this area but it all worked well. Excellent location with walks around the docks and restaurants also.The hotel restaurant and bar looked great also.Breakfast was lovely and fresh every staff member we dealt with could not do enough and was extremely professional such a breath of fresh air after a truly awful experience which actually was why we stayed here to begin with.We booked via phone the professionalism started there.Really had a great stay be aware the exit is quite narrow from the car park when you leave this is the only small comment I have.We will return as it’s convenient and ticks all the boxes Thank you great staff and great hotel ,6-May-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

The hotel was great' and the girl at the desk by the name Sahara was the nicest and the most helpful I've ever met in my entire traveling life. go there and ask for her! she changed our whole experience and made it so much better!,27-Apr-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html
"Arrived in the evening by local train. Just a short walk from the station. Luckily could see the hotel as the signposting is not the best.Lobby access via elevator, the lobby is on an upper floor. Nice bar area and all very spacious and modern.Arrived around 9pm, counters were staffed and checkin was fast. Got an update, which was a nice gesture considering that I stayed in total for only 6 hours.Suit with many windows and very comfortable. Great bed and bathrrom facilities.I have had an early flight and could not take breakfast, generally starting too late for a hotel which is close to an airport, even so it is only London City.Checkout in the morning was fine and fast as well. Called a cap for me, got easily to the airport.Considering the hotel prices in London this hotel is very cheap but still convinient, it is easy to go by train to the city. Airport City easy to reach.

"Would I have chosen to stay here if I was visiting London for the weekend? No. However, if you are attending the Excel for a conference or concert, then look no further, the hotels location is perfect.The hotel itself is nice. It's clean and tidy and well appointed. However, if you are driving to the hotel, please be careful in the carpark as it's the most dangerous car park I have ever been in, in terms of space. Just to give you an idea, we had to fold our mirrors in just to get through the barrier and our car is a standard size. The scrapes and marks on the walls will show you where to be cautious.The room again was clean and tidy and well appointed and came with a bath (although not full size) and a walk in shower. The only thing missing from the bathroom was the toilet! This was tucked away in a separate room right next to the front door. This to be honest was a pain. They would be better off ditching the small bath and replacing it with a toilet. I know it doesn't sound much but when it's dark early in the morning and you have to trapes to the front door to find the toilet, then when you find it you have to squeeze your way in as it's that small, it can become a chore.That said, the room came with a kettle, minibar (payable), iron and ironing board, hairdryer and small TV. One good touch was there were USB charging points next to the bed, which was a bonus. One thing that did annoy me was the temperature of the room. It was just too hot. The aircon didn't work and the window only opened slightly for safety reasons. To be honest, I could not get a good night sleep for that reason and ended up clock watching all night.Breakfast was included in the rate and it was perfect. The restaurant was clean and tables were plentiful. The food was excellent and some of the dishes could be made to order. No complaints there at all.Would I stay here when visiting the excel again? Given that's it's a 5 minute walk away, maybe so. However, I did have a better experience staying at the Hilton last year, which was a 15 minute walk away, so maybe not.",6-Apr-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

"Well what can I say about this hotel apart from absolutely Amazing!!!! My partner and I stayed here last night for our anniversary and I wanted to make it extra special. I was in contact with the hotel to explain that I had a few things planned and needed the staff help to pull it off and WOW!!!! They went beyond the extra mile. I booked a Superior Queen Room and they upgraded our room to a Suite without my knowledge until I checked in. We have entered the room and they have made a love heart using some rose petals on the bed as well as 2 love swans. I had a bouquet of flowers delivered to hotel earlier and I had arranged when we went out that the hotel set up the room with the flowers and rose petals that I supplied them. On returning to the suite my Partner was amazed wowed and gobsmacked (very rare) with the amazing job that they did and they also did us complimentary Prosecco and a Happy Anniversary Cake. Sarah was the main part of this amazing night she has gone miles past the extra mile, but I would like to say a massive thank you to ALL the hotel staff and I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone. Once again thanks to all the staff and especially Sarah!!!!",16-Mar-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html
"Very basic hotel and I am quite surprised it is a 4 star! Unlike most 4 star premises it did not have a Nespresso coffee maker. There were no small face clothes, bath robes or slippers. The matress needs replacing as the springs are badly worn. The heating in my room was not working at all and even though I reported this it was not resolved. I refuse to pay £21-95 for breakfast that is sheer madness when I had a thoroughly decent full English in a cafe just 1 minute walk from the hotel!

The hotel location is good to reach by DLR and is close to London City Airport (a taxi ride to there is about 12 GBP) and also to the cable car over the Tames (about 7 minutes of walking). Hotel staff was very kind and helpful, especially in the restaurant. We would like to mention specifically Nicoleta. There are several small restaurants for every kind of tasted in the area for those looking for a meal outside of the hotel; we preferred to eat at the hotel as it was very good and at the right price.The only disadvantage is that the hotel is not so close to Central London, but it is easily and relatively fast to go there by the Jubilee Line from Canning Town.

The reception staff were polite and friendly, we were given an upgrade which wasn't expected and our room was slightly larger.

We stayed this time for 5 nights and loved having the luxury of a suite for my 60th birthday. The staff couldn't be more helpful: from the people in the breakfast room who provide a delicious buffet to the people who tidy the rooms, and the reception staff who will look after your suitcase if you want a few more hours in London. We loved coming back in the evening by the Thames Clipper and seeing London lit up at night, and then travelling on the Emirates Line high over the river back to reach the hotel within about 10 minutes walk.

"I stayed here for one night prior to a flight from London City Airport. The hotel is well connected to the Docklands Light Railway and extremely close to the western entrance of London Excel; it was only a short (and inexpensive) trip round to the airport in the morning on the DLR.My room was booked with a third party (via a 'secret rate', which offered a slight discount off the hotel's own rate) and whilst I appreciate that no points are payable on such a rate, it is a shame that points are also not provided for incidental spend (e.g. in the bar).The room itself was in very good condition and well laid out, with a comfortable bed - perfectly suitable for a single night stay. Food in the bar was good quality and reasonable value, although I would prefer to see some more standard tables/chairs as well as the less formal seating. There is a terrace with a fine view of the river and the O2, although it was a little cold to stay out there too long this time. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment on this.I would happily visit again, assuming a reasonable rate.",4-Jan-19,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html
"I called the hotel to request a rate for a room. The person working on the front desk answered the phone “err ... hello” with an attitude. Hardly the welcome one would expect to receive from staff at a Novotel hotel. The person continued to give me an attitude because they were unable to provide a rate and claimed he was looking into it. However he actually transferred me to a central reservations team who did not answer the line , and the cal bounced back to him . For this reason he was rude and unapologetic for his tone and manner. When I asked whether an early check in would be possible he seemed uninterested in helping and finished off by telling me that there is nothing more he can do , and was incredibly rude unfriendly and inexperienced. Terrible service and would not expect that level of poor treatment from any 4 star hotel",31-Dec-18,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

"We Stayed at this hotel from Xmas Eve to Boxing Day! Me and my two kids (age 20 & 12) It was a change from the routine Xmas at home, so we were really looking forward to it! It didn’t disappoint at all. My daughter met us there, so had already checked in, so I wasn’t able to feel the reception at reception. My daughter said they were nice and friendly! The location was perfect, situated right next to the Sunborn London, floating hotel! Beautiful boat. You can go in for drinks in the main bar and stand outside on its deck to take pics. But back to the Novotel hotel! The bar was great, service was spot on, we ordered food (see pictures) a lot. The young lady and the bar manager/supervisor (Male short guy didn’t get his name) were so lovely, making an effort to chat to us! Nice touch! The bar food was amazing. We had the chicken wings and nachos. For just bar food it was good! Prices were standard for London! The room was nice and adequate! Seperate toilet by the front door and bath and shower inside the room! It was perfect for our short stay. The Car park was based under the hotel and for 3 days 2 nights we were charged £16. I was impressed with that, I assume we were not charged for a Bank holiday! All in all great stay. There is a local Nisa and Tesco Express a 1 min walk away! This place had all that we needed! Looking forward to returning. I would recommend, definitely. Enjoy. Keep up the good work Novotel Excel London.

"Arrived home from a fantastic stay at this hotel on Friday, boyfriend booked this as a birthday treat to see Hamilton (which we are both obsessed with) back in May, when we arrived we were greeted with smiles and instantly felt like we were at home, parking was very secure and at £16 a night is a bargain considering what it would cost to travel on the train from Liverpool. We let ourselves in to our room and couldn't believe how beautiful it was with a view of the Thames and the ExCel business centre, with a waterfall shower. I work in a hotel my self so to be able to relax in such a lovely room was perfect, the rooms were quiet and basically soundproof, we went out for tea that night and came back and had a few drinks in the lovely bar, as we went back in to our room my boyfriend proposed to me and I really couldn't of thought of a better place for him to have done it. The pizza that we ordered on the Thursday night was beautiful and we definitely will be visiting again!

"This was quite a disappointment. We chose this Accor hotel because I am an A Club member and wanted to take my wife to London for her birthday. It is a fairly modern building and in a good location if you are going to the O2 as we were.I booked direct and asked a question at that time.No response.Later I emailed directly after my wife had an operation on her foot which meant we had to drive there.There was a delay of a day or two before I got a reply. They confirmed that there was parking and said we could have it for only £8 a day. They also said they would upgrade our room and it would be nearer the lift so my wife had less distance to walk.Very kind.We arrived and drove into the ground level car park and up a level. There was plenty of room but I was glad my car was not larger- the exit in particular is VERY narrow.We went to check in. Oddly there is a lift from the ground floor and mezzanine to the Reception which is on the second floor. You then catch a completely separate lift to your room. Not particularly convenient with luggage or if you have mobility issues.We were given Room 539. If it was an upgrade then the standard rooms can't be too impressive.It was not near the lifts. It was an OK room- as good as a Travelodge or Premier Inn. The view was nice. Good wardrobe and storage space. Mini fridge with free water. Desk and a smallish TV with limited channels. No details of the hotel and facilities to speak of.Comfy bedThe toilet was separate from the bathroom. And small. The bathroom was also small- a walk in shower and small sink. Not much room to put your toiletries.Free wi fi and a USB socket by the headboard.We didn't have breakfast there but had an unremarkable evening meal at the Upper Deck. I was glad I kept my jacket on as it was cold by the window. Service was casual and not really attentive.The worst example of the poor quality attitude from the staff came when I went to pay for parking. Three staff were on Reception - one was dealing with a couple checking in. The other two were studiously looking at their computer screens ignoring me.Another guest then arrived and went up to one of the Receptionists who duly served him, ignoring the fact I had been waiting.When I did get served I was asked if I had stayed at the hotel. I had to show her the email offering parking at half price.It took quite a while for her to validate my parking ticket and to pay (no contactless here) and then she told me that the pass was valid for only 10 minutes!Given my wife's mobility problem and getting our luggage to the car plus setting up the sat nav this was hardly up to standard.On the plus side my wife did get a free birthday cake after we arrived.Would I stay there again? Because of the poor quality of the staff: no. Urgent need for training in customer care here. Other hotels exist in the area.",16-Dec-18,Novotel London Excel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d291617-Reviews-Novotel_London_Excel-London_England.html

"Only one room was ready out of the two we booked when we tried to check in at 2pm, when questioned they stated that they try to have at least one room ready with multiple bookings when concerts are on. So after 5 of us got ready in a twin room! Later we came back after the concert and got the keys to our other room... which was on a different floor, not exactly ideal. We decided to order room service, unfortunately after trying to ring down to order 7 times we gave up and headed down to reception. When we got down there an upset guest was having a disagreement with a member of the reception team, security were present but the guest was clearly distressed and the member of staff on reception was a arguing with her and raising his voice! We then were told it was a 45 minute wait for room service so said we would go and check with the other members of our group to see if they were happy with that and that we’d call down, he assured us he would answer when we did.... he did not answer when we tried to call. Back down to reception we headed to say we’d still like to order our cheese toasties and margarita pizzas. After an hour wait we called reception to see how much longer it was going to be, they hadn’t put our order through!! No apology, nothing! I requested complimentary breakfast the following morning as compensation as we had stayed up until 2am and had to go to bed hungry. The next morning we were seated in the restaurant by who I assume to be the manager, only to be approached by a waiter and informed that breakfast had closed! Not happy, so we made do with what food was left over but the glares we got from staff and being tidied around made us all feel uncomfortable. I informed the member of staff on reception when we checked out as he asked how our stay was so I told him, the same manager that seated us then came out and said “What’s the problem? You ate.”",10-Jul-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html

I’ve only given 4 stars as I booked for a concert at Wembley, it’s a good half hour on the tube and not the easiest route.

"Hotel and room were good. Very pricey but expected as there was an event on at Wembley over the weekend! Fairly newly opened too I believe. Air conditioned through out. SKY TV available which was great. Lovely bathroom and decent sized bath towels and bath robes! Breakfast very crowded and a not much to talk about - I could do better. Tube station opposite the hotel so very good location for Wembley as we were attending a concert. Room Service however is another thing. Ordered food just after getting back from the concert , tired and hungry. 45 minutes it eventually turned up without any drinks and was cold. Complained and asked for a refund. Still waiting for the refund. They obviously cannot cope when there are events on in the area as other people were having problems with room service too. Apart from that great.",2-Jul-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html

"Plus points for this hotel are that it is next to the Park Royal Underground Station, where the Piccadilly line runs. It means a direct train to central London, eg. Leicester square and Oxford station is possible. It is a long ride though. Amenities in the room are very basic. Room size is acceptable, fairly new and no frills. Breakfast was good and staff were friendly. Front reception staff are helpful. Loved the gym. Room service food quality was lacking. And the housekeeping team needs a lot of work- the room was barely done when we returned after a long day, at most the bed was done as bathroom towel exchanged.

"Was here for a work conference for 4 days, room was a really good size and was cleaned daily. To my surprise after getting out of the shower went to grab the towel that the hotel supplied to find a massive brown stain on the towel, Looking further into it, it was someone else's fasces I was absolutely fuming marched down to reception and showed them they also looked horrified and apologised but that was it can you imagine if I didn't look and actually dried myself with this towel! At the evening I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings and found a full fish that looked like it had been fried multiple times asked the waiter if it was supposed to be there as I ordered chicken not a random whitebait he just laughed and said i'll tell the chef.

A well situated hotel opposite the Park Royal tube station. Rooms were very well laid out and the bed very comfortable. If I have one criticism its that the car park is rather small. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast but found that there wasn't much space between tables so we kept getting bumped by people walking behind us. The food was very good with plenty of variety. Those coming down later for breakfast found they had to wait for a table.,25-Jun-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html
"Worst experience ever. Even a 2 stars hotel was a better service. We arrived on Friday at past 2 pm, room for 3. When we came into the room, all the dirty towels and bed sheets were on the floor, nothing had been cleaned up and it was disgusting. We complained at the reception, they decided to change the room. So we had to go back to the room (and we were already in a rush) and move our stuff. But.. This room was ready for 2 persons. Only 2 towels, third bed not done. The guy told us they would do call someone to do it. We left at approximately 3.30 pm. We went to Wembley for a show. We came back at 1 am. Guess what. NOTHING had been done!!! We went back to the reception and and told them.. We went to the bar for a drink, so that would give them some time. At 1.30 am we went back to our room. What the hell. Still nothing had been done and we were really pissed off. We had to wait for them to make the bed and bring towels to take our shower and go to sleep. Had to wait 20 more minutes. A total joke. A 4 stars hotel?! You make us wait 2am to get our room ready? I wished they would have made a discount at least!!! This is not acceptable.

"All in all very good but some of the staff need to learn what they have got on site as ordered from drinks menu to be told we don’t have that, if there was a bar tender around, waited 20 minutes to be served at the bar and then bar tender trying to take the lid off a bottle of beer with an ice scoop( was frightened he was going to lose his thumb) put a bottle opener under the bar",24-Jun-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html
"Me and my husband recently stayed here for one night, as we were seeing a concert in Wembely Stadium. The hotel has good transport links from central London and the Park Royal underground station is directly opposite the hotel accessed via the underpass.First impressions were really good.The hotel is very modern and hi-tech.Check in was easy and the staff were very helpful.We asked them to pre book a taxi for us to Wembley Stadium as we found this would be quicker than catching the tube as despite the underground being so close,there are no direct tube lines into Wembley from Park Royal underground station.When we got to our room we were thouroghly impressed.The hotel had kindly decorated our bed with confetti and made our towels into swans!The room was huge and had everything we needed and more.The mood lighting was cool and the bathrobes,slippers and complimentary Elemis spa toiletries in the bathroom were a nice touch.We were gutted we were only staying the one night as the room had exceeded our expectations.We then had a drink in the bar while waiting for our taxi.Bar service was quick despite how busy it was due to the other concert goers being there.When we arrived back at our room after the concert, we were very grateful that we had been left 2 complimentary bags of crisps and there was 2 small bottles of vodka and 2 small cans of coke in the fridge.The hotel certainly went over and above by providing these for us.After a very comfortable nights sleep we then went down for breakfast.We went about 8am and we had no problems in getting a table.There was hot buffet,continental,crosiants and pastries and cereal on offer,fresh juice and tea and coffee machines.We found the breakfast to be very tasty.We could have asked for poached or fried eggs if we didn't want the scrambled that was on offer.Overall we had a fantastic nights stay at this ultra modern hotel.As stated the room had exceeded our expectations and we wished we could have stayed an extra night.My only bad point really is the hotel isn't as close to Wembley as first thought.It is not possible to walk there due to the busy main road,and despite the underground being so close, there were no direct tube lines going into Wembley.We would have had to get back into central London just to get on the direct line.Much easier and quicker book a taxi to get you to Wembley.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",24-Jun-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html
"We stayed here for a recent concert at Wembley Stadium. The hotel is directly opposite the Park Royal underground station. The reception area is very modern and bright with really helpful staff. We were in a deluxe king room on the second floor. It was really spacious, the bed was comfy and the control of all the lights from the control pad by the bed was great. The bathroom/shower was modern and spacious, but what set it apart for me was the large bath sheet towels. As someone who stands 6ft 3"", there's nothing worse than staying in a hotel with tiny towels that you can't even wrap around your waist!We didn't have breakfast, but glad we didn't judging by some of the other reviews on here.

"Good for Wembley. Don’t expect room service as it’s too busy after a show, don’t expect a relaxing breakfast. The area is ridiculously small. The bar and reception seating area needs to be reduced to allow for breakfast guest chaos. The wait for being seated is long (I understand this), however, the worst wait is in the buffet restaurant as there were no plates, cups, glasses. Want eggs other than scrambled? No chance. The poor staff are too busy trying to get cutlery and plates out. Guests were sharing a cup between them if they were lucky! Shocking. I attempted calling reception several times, room service, the works. No answer each time. The staff levels are terrible and the complimentary vodka, tonic and bag of crisps (between two guests) caused mass confusion as no card from the hotel stating it was complimentary. Rooms are good enough and clean (we had a king studio). I have never stayed at a Park Plaza and experienced this level of chaos before - ever! This hotel needs some serious fine-tuning.

"Our room is lovely, spacious and an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom is well equipped although the placement of the toilet roll holder is not ideal! There isn’t a bath but the shower is good. However the bar and subsequently the room service leaves a lot to be desired. The bar was slow with young staff who didn’t know the drinks menu. They had sold out of various drinks which I find most unusual in a hotel of this class. We then decided to order room service......... the phone rang for ages unanswered I then tried the front desk with again no answer. As we were very hungry I went back downstairs to reception. There I was told that as the hotel was extremely busy only the pizza margarita and the ham and cheese toastie was available. I ordered these an hour ago and we are still waiting!!

The breakfast isn't Brill the coffee machines often stop working and they run out of cups or milk jugs.

"Booked as we were going to Wembley. Paid extra for a third person yet this person was not catered for. Arrived and sent up to the room where there was a pull out bed without any bedding, there were not enough towels or coffee for the machine. We called down but after no response, went and asked. They said they’d send someone up. This person came hours later after we had left. When we returned, a door person wouldn’t let us in until they’d checked our room key and when we went up whilst the bed had been made, there still wasn’t enough towels, mugs and toiletries. They had also taken our drinks out of the mini bar fridge (which had nothing in to begin with). Our room was clearly by the laundry as we were woken up by what sounded like washing machines. The bathroom sliding door didn’t fully close and this along with the fact the shower/toilet door not fully closing either meant you couldn’t be in the bathroom in privacy. The shower water leaked through from the shower into the toilet. We booked here as it said close links to Wembley Stadium. You can’t walk there even if you wanted to so add on travel. We expressed our disappointment at check out and were offered a complimentary drink but considering our room cost nearly £250 and we were actually treated as a couple, we should have been offered some money back.

If I had to say anything negative, we had previously stayed in another of this chain's hotels in London and booked the same class of room.

"The feeling of exclusivity, great design in the common spaces and the rooms. There were too small door handles, tight hinges and defective locks in the lobby. This made the doors difficult to open after completing the toilet visit. As well as the leakage from the shower door into the room, this was a sliding door that covered the shower or toilet.

i arrived in london from holland and had to negotiate my way via the tube . when i got to park royal station no lift only two flights of stairs.holy schweppes i was lucky a couple of young men helped me get the bags up the stairs. i could see the hotel on the opposite side of the road with no visible way of getting to it. at the station they told me there was a underpass up the road which i managed to negotiate with difficulty. the hotel staff were what id call ok not fabulous but ok . the room was really good no complaints there. when i went for breakfast the place was packed out. admittedly it was easter weekend. the funny thing was you couldn't put the cost of breakfast onto your bill you had to pay there and then . i had communication problems with the girl on the counter saying i wanted to be charged in pound on my debit card. it was like barking up a gumtree. people were asking when all the different things that had run out would be replaced. eventually most gave up . it appeared most staff didn't have english as a first language. this was something i found all over the uk . when i had to leave for heathrow i was faced with the prospect of getting my luggage to the station and hoping i could find someone to help me. when i booked this hotel it advertises that its close to heathrow.nothing about needing a car to get there. i asked staff roughly what the price of a taxi would be and nearly had cardiac arrest. note to self check that nearest tube station has a lift next .,19-May-19,Park Plaza London Park Royal,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d11717496-Reviews-Park_Plaza_London_Park_Royal-London_England.html
"I was not impressed with the staff service. Arrived at my hotel and there was no condiments (tea/coffee) in the room to go with my cup and kettle. I ordered breakfast to the room (no charge) on the first day and they did not bring the right breakfast. I had selected banana on the menu but they then said they didn’t do this anymore. The staff member went back down to get pastries and a different fruit and returned with only pastries. I then ordered breakfast the second day (included in my booking) and was charged nearly £5 just for it to be brought to my room. The following day I went downstairs for breakfast. I asked were the vegetarian options were as this was on the menu. Waited a while for someone to check and was told they would bring me vegetarian sausages. I had finished my whole breakfast and waited for an extra 5-10mins and this never arrived, I eventually left. Room was clean and of good quality and facilities at hotel are good.

"Due to an exceptional case, we cancelled a booking for five nights at central London and luckily found Park Plaza at Park Loyal with reasonable price. It turns out to be a good choice. From the very beginning I was a bit disappointed by the location of this hotel because it is at 3rd district in London (according to London Tube map) so it takes more time to visit city center. However, we soon got used to this distance and became comfortable because of the easy access to the tube itself. The hotel is so close to the tube station that the distance does not bother any more. It was also disappointing when I entered into the room after check-in due to bad smell. I even wanted to quit staying here. The staff accepted my complain about the smell and tried to change the room for me. One day after I got to learn that the smell comes from the chemical cleaning stuff. The hotel has indeed a ""Go Green"" plan, for which you may even get 10 pound discount if you skip the room service per night. In order to avoid that smell, I've chosen the Go Green option. The towels got updated still every day, which is pretty enough for us. The bed is comfortable here. Space is enough to turn around. TV is also a good set. On the day for an early check-out, hotel has also prepared breakfast-takeway for us. This is also nice. The downside is that I don't like the detergent which this hotel has used. It smelled so awful and I got indeed sick of it after one and half hour stay.

Rooms are small and uncomfortable. No privacy in bathroom. The room service food was not good. The best thing about the hotel is its location right across the street from a train stop.

Regarding the food, I can say that I had a good experience, mostly with breakfast.The service was more then for a 4 stars hotel and I really want to mention Vito and Ioana (she always smiles!) that with their kindness and professionalism made my stay very nice.

Situated close to two London Underground stations and inside Zone 3. The hotel was clean and ideal for a business stay. The hotel room was a reasonable size and the breakfast was adequate.

"Stayed here for an event in Wembley. Location is ok. The rooms are modern but have some odd design features that don’t work well. The shower pressure is weak and the water leaks under the sliding door. The door slides between the toilet and shower lacking privacy. The cleanliness is what really lets this hotel down. (See pictures) Rubbish in the car park, bins over flowing. Hair in the sink. Food trays left outside room , they were there when we checked in and still there when we checked out. The bed was large and comfy. The breakfast was good , but be prepared to wait. Very small dinning room. Wouldn’t stay here again, disappointing from a large hotel chain. I have given 3 stars due to the comfy bed and good breakfast and that is being generous. No excuse for cleanliness not being up to scratch.

"Un professional, amateurish staff they do not know the meaning of hospitality. A simple mobile charger went missing from my room and I was accused of lying and making up the story.The housekeeping is made up of foreign nationals with no idea of customer relations they are just there to get paid coffee beans. Rude and arrogant to say the least especially the housekeeper. Hotel Manager of the same character not even bothering to meet me and explain the situation.

"This is a combined hotel and residence for staff at the neighbouring St George's Hospital. The hotel section and staff are welcoming and the hotel appears functional if not glamorous or exciting. The room we had was small but adequate for our needs. A comfortable double bed (hard mattress if that's your thing!), a clothes hanging area, TV, safe, desk and good bathroom with walk-in shower. The ""restaurant"" is small and very simple - almost hostel like in its design and decor. The only reason the hotel did not get a 5 for me was the fact that the drinks served as part of the £5.99 continental breakfast are instant. The food is cheap and unexciting but serves a fuelling purpose.The location is ideal for exploring Wimbledon, Richmond and the surrounding areas and is only 15 minutes walk from a tube station.

"I have stayed here 3 weeks in a row for work but won’t be back. I paid extra to secure a ‘deluxe double’ room this week instead of the ‘cosy double’. There is absolutely no difference! I am sure the hotel manager will jump on this and reply that the room is bigger but it isn’t. I was in a cosy double last week and it was exactly that - cosy. But I expected it and paid for that so it was fine. This week I wanted more space as I’ll be in the room for longer doing some work - but it’s essentially the same room as the ‘cosy’ just with the bathroom door in a different place. Technically it might be bigger but only because there is a tiny bit of hallway (absolutely no extra not useful space).Very disappointed with the service when I called to query the room. No resolution offered.The first time I stayed I had an amazing ‘deluxe room’ with lots of space - so I know they exist!Also, the breakfast is crap (the cheapest supermarket style bread which can be toasted and pastries out of a packet), don’t bother unless it’s included in your room rate. Lastly there was noise all night from the hospital and the stupid doorbell that goes off every time someone uses the lift.Save your money and go somewhere else.Gave 2 stars as it was very clean.",30-Apr-19,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

"Some may not agree but i feel like i still want to put my point across. I was very much looking forward to staying here as it looks beautiful and good value for money, and I still think that even after this review but id still like to say my bit.I was very disappointed with this hotel before id even arrived, as id booked this hotel via booking.com because its close to the hospital, my brother has been in and out of there for a few years. Turns out he got moved hospitals and I needed to change locations! Not ideal I know, especially with the hotel being non-refundable but I know you can request to cancel and receive a refund. Id emailed twice and still 3 days later had heard nothing, so I phoned the hotel to which they say they definitely do offer a refund, its booking.com who don't.. So, I call booking.com, they made numerous phone calls and emails to the property with no reply so I requested a call back. Received my call informing me that the hotel have given me false information about cancellation/refunds, they even tried to get at least half back for me considering the circumstances but still they wouldn't agree. Very poor customer service over the phone from the property, and to be told false information isn't good either.

"The hotel itself is great, everything you need and perfect location if going to St George's. It is noisy however - the fire doors on the rooms bang when they shut and if nearby your whole room shakes! Obviously it's on the hospital grounds so you hear everything from ambulances to the laundry carts rumbling along throughout the early hours. The lift also makes an arrival noise which is really annoying when people are coming and going all hours.The hotel is spotless and comfortable. Shower really good.

"For its location (12 mins walk from tube and at least 4 bus routes start from right outside the front door) it is clean and good value. Early (2pm) check in is useful too. Rooms are as pictured in terms of quality and good in terms of size given the price. I've stayed in much smaller and much more expensive double rooms in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Very helpful staff on 24 hour front desk. We needed to extend our stay and they were able to let us move our bags straight from one room to the other rather than checking out at 11am, leaving bags with reception, then checking in at 2pm. Tooting Broadway has a good choice of good eateries (cafes, restaurants, pubs) and shops too including Sainsburys, Aldi and Lidl Supermarkets very near the tube station. Tubes very frequent and it's easy to change at Stockwell to the opposite platform to get Victoria line to/from West End or stay on Northern Line via Bank for the East/City or via Charing Cross for Central London. Note: Pelican Hotel is next to St Georges Hospital with a busy Emergency Department so I was concerned we may get disturbed through the night by ambulances/sirens coming and going but we didn't hear a single one whilst at the hotel (for 5 nights Tue-Sat).

"I tend to agree with one of the earlier reviews saying that the photos are deceptive. The rooms was much smaller in real life, there website did have the room dimensions on it, but if your like most people it will mean nothing to you, because we don't tend to know or use sq ft when we are talking about room sizes. The staff were very helpful and friendly, I was a bit concerned to see that they didn't have mattress protectors on the beds and only one thin sheet between me and the stained mattress. You had to pay £5.99 for breakfast, but I didn't feel that it was really worth it. It was a very, very basic continental breakfast. A few cereal chooses, few tea bags and coffee, a couple of croissants and cinnamon swirls with bread and a couple of apples and bananas and that's it! I would of gone to a local café if I knew the breakfast was that limited. I would say it is more of a stop gap rather than a place to stay for a longer period of time.Also please be aware that no other meals is provided at this hotel other than breakfast.",17-Sep-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

Hotel facilities and rooms were fine for the price. The aircon worked well which was useful in this heat. Reception staff were fantastic. Gerome / Jerome helped me print a document I had forgotten and was very helpful.

"I was looking for a hotel that was close enough to the AELTC so I could easily to get Wimbledon in a short time, and in that regard, the Pelican fit the bill, as it only took about 15 minutes in a cab to get to the grounds. I pre-paid via a travel site. It is located adjacent to St. George Hospital, and as such, not terribly close to much dining or shopping as it available in other parts of London, though Tooting High Street is a close walk, which as a few cafes and what not. The closest metro is Tooting Broadway, about a 10-15 minute walk, so I ended up taking cabs when I was pressed for time. The room itself was large, with a small TV, desk, an iron and ironing board and a safe. My particular had two twin beds and some sort of pull-out chair thing, which was not ideal for me as I was just one (large) person, but I just went with it. The bathroom was also a nice size. There are not drink machines, but you can buy Diet Coke and Coke Zero from the reception. All in all, a decent, if unremarkable stay.",2-Jul-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"The place is dirty the staff are unhelpful to the point of rude. We had a 3 day stay in June 2018 Due to a Funeral and this is close, we booked as it is part of the Hospital and should be good and clean as we suspect it is used by people that are there for sick and dying relatives, the breakfast continental so a bit of a joke £5.99 the hotel charge £282 for 3 nights (no breakfast) so that is the room cost. I will post some phots of the filthy state of the bed and the shower. I raised the issues with the staff and the only offer we were given was a free night. The noise outside the rooms keep you awake at night. Who in there right mind would want to stay any longer than is necessary. This hotel has a captive audience as part of the Hospital. There photos on line look like they have been photo-shopped. This is as we saw it and would never go back. Spoke to the manager when we got home as not available when we were there. His comment was do what you got to do and hung up on us.",22-Jun-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"If you can get a deal on this hotel, you’re in luck because you get a great little hotel for your money. Very modern, very clean and nice and quiet rooms. The worst thing, and this is a stretch to complain about anything, is the very slow lifts. There’s 2 of them and they take a long time to arrive, especially if they are stopping at floors.Will be staying again in the future for work.",20-Jun-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"This is an adequate hotel, but not worth the cost. I found out after booking for its proximity to something else that the reason it is priced well above what is provided is because it is literally on the grounds of St George's Hospital, so of course people stay there who are visiting relatives etc.When they say it is quiet, what they mean is that it is located approximately 15 minutes walk from any other shops or amenities besides the hospital. It was a pleasant enough stay, but breakfast was not included and I will not be returning.",6-Jun-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"The room Is nice.very small but nice, with kettle and tea/coffee. Free toiletries too. That’s about it. No restaurant. No microwave, nothing. How can they call it a hotel and for £80 a night? It’s a distance from the main High street, so, if you’re a lone female, or just someone of a nervous nature, best to catch a bus or get a cab. This is a no smoking hotel, however, the person in the room next door is smoking me out. Management have had a word, but, they’re still smoking.

"Stayed here for one night on business. Basic no frills kind of place but very clean. Continental breakfast only which is not my favourite. Plenty of pubs and restaurants short walk away. Was able to walk from Tooting Broadway Underground in about 15minutes.Situated next to a hospital and not sure if suited for tourism purely due to location but for me, on this visit, was what I needed.

"I visited here for 4 nights from the 2nd to the 6th April 2018 for work purposes.I stayed in the deluxe studio which are based on the ground floor. The studio is modern with a kitchenette (no utensils, not even cutlery, although was provided with it when asked) and TV.The hob is an induction job and I couldnt use it because i didn’t have the right utensils. The WiFi works fine.There is a buffet breakfast from 7am to 10am for £5.99 which is continental breakfast (cereals, juice, fruits, yoghurt, coffee and croissant). Not really worth the price. The TV cannot be connected to the internet so you can’t stream anything on the television from your smart devices.The closest underground stations are Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood which are a 15-20 minute walk.Also, the deluxe studio is facing the cemetery across the road and is right beside St George’s hospital.Not a place I would visit again.",14-Apr-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"My sister and I stood at the pelican on our first trip to London, i booked really fast and didn’t notice it was so far out. It was a great hotel, cozy and perfect for two people. The rooms were clean and everything was perfect! I wouldn’t stay there again just due to the fact that’s it’s kinda far from everything. We would go out sightseeing and we would have to take the train to a bus just to get to the hotel. Not convenient if you are a tourist.

"I needed a hotel close to St.George’s Hospital. This hotel is the PERFECT location as access to the hospital grounds is an immediate left hand turn from the hotel entrance. I felt save when walking to and from the hotel in the evenings. The reception staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and stylish, excellent value for money, I was very impressed.The one down-side was breakfast. I had breakfast one morning, the rest of the time I bought fruit, yogurt and porridge pots to eat in my room. The continental style breakfast had limited choice and no coffee machine, only instant sachets, which was disappointing. Premier Inn charge a couple of pounds more for breakfast, with far more choice and a Costa coffee machine. I also found the woman who greeted guests for breakfast, rather abrupt. She was sitting at one of the tables doing paperwork when I arrived and did not smile when I walked in. This surprised me as the receptionists were so friendly as were the cleaners.I would recommend this hotel and stay again but would not waste my money on the breakfast.",23-Mar-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

"Stayed just the one night (4th March) - wish had been longer! The room we had (111) was superb. Larger than expected, with everything we needed. The twin beds were super comfortable - firm but not hard, linen good quality, very good night's sleep. At one end of the room was a built-in wardrobe (with 7 hangers and not the annoying fixed kind)), dresser and desk plus a chair. All good quality. There's a very comfortable sofa too, with space for two people. A large TV hung on the wall opposite the beds, with a decent selection of tv and radio stations. There's also an iron and board (didn't use), safe (didn't use), kettle and selection of tea, instant coffee, milk and biscuits. Lots of different lights and lamps too. The bathroom was big, with an excellent shower: very roomy, very good pressure, no end of hot water. Little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bodywash were supplied, as well as good quality toilet paper and plenty of towels. Both the bathroom and bedroom had large mirrors. Very large windows, with both muslin and curtains. Aircon/heater worked greated. Wi-fi was absolutely fine. Check-in quick and easy and friendly. Check out time is 11am. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel... We didn't try the breakfast so can't comment on that but the hospital next door has a cafe and canteen (and small Marks & Spencers too) and The immediate vicinity of the hotel is quiet, right by a hospital, so no issues with traffic noise. It's a one minute walk from the bus stop, or about 12 mins walk from Tooting Broadway tube station and a large Sainsburys supermarket, and five mins walk from the main street where there is a great selection of cafes, restaurants etc. In fact, Tooting is a great neighbourhood. I was travelling with my elderly mother, who especially appreciated the spacious shower and room. Finally, our room was under £50 which is exceptional value for money. We will definitely be returning.",6-Mar-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
I’ve stayed here at least 2 nights a week for the past few years and found the staff excellent and very friendly. The rooms are modern and clean and if you want a light breakfast the food is fine.

"Myself and the wife stopped for one night. Its a pleasant clean and cosy hotel, we stopped on the lower floor, en-suite was nice. A very cosy room but thats expected in London. The only downside was the restaurant was under renovation and we wasn’t told prior to our stay. We took a walk through Tooting to find somewhere to eat. Not to far of a walk and the pubs and restaurants start. Overall a pleasant stay",28-Feb-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"Stayed for 2 nights whilst attending a training course at St Georges Hospital. Location on site for the Hospital so could not be better. Room clean neat and well appointed. Hairdrier, soaps, shampoos, tea, coffee & biscuits. Helpful reception who recommended where to find an evening meal. Did not try the continental breakfast as we had breakfast on the course. Not sure I would recommend as a holiday stay but otherwise perfectly fine.",26-Feb-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"I booked a single room for two nights while my son was staying in St George's Hospital. The hotel is almost in the hospital grounds and it only took 5 minutes from the hotel to my son's ward. The hotel from the outside looks like a 13 storey block of flats, but inside it is light and modern and clean. My single room was well equipped and clean ... all except a horrible mustard cushion which had a couple of nasty stains on it, but I chucked that on the floor anyway. I maybe should have taken it down to reception. The bed was bigger than the average single, about 4' wide, so plenty of room to stretch out. There was a wall mounted telly at the end of the bed and the usual kettle with complimentary tea/coffee/biscuits. The bathroom was spotless with a nice powerful shower, fluffy towels and complimentary bath gel, shampoo and confitioner. I didn't see a hair dryer but later found this in the drawer beside the bed.The price of my room included breakfast, although they also provide this as an addition at £5.99 pp for those rooms where it is not included.. This is a continental style breakfast and although not a huge choice included cornflakes, museli, fruit, yogurts, white/brown bread (with a toaster), jams, pre-packed cheese and a selection of croissants and pastries. There was also tea, coffee and a couple of different fruit juices. The hotel certainly served my purpose very well and the cost was very reasonable. The only downside to the hotel is the fact that it is about 15 minutes walk to Tooting High Street, there is nowhere to get any food nearby in the evening after leaving the hospital, and there is no car parking.",7-Feb-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"The rooms were better than expected, modern. The locaction is so, so as is not very close to the city center, Tooting, the price was good, the bad was the breakfast, too basic.Reception: Was fine, kinda cold but okRoom: The best of this hotel, it was modern, although you have the view to the street you also have the view to the cementery, but anyways is ok (if you dont care)Location: Is so so, if you come by bus is perfect cause the bus station is very near, but if you come by subway the city center is not that close you have to walk several blocks.Breakfast: I was in several countries and this was the more basic breakfast I had, I was the only on the breakfast room by the way. Just to tell you that there's not coffe machine but just instat coffe packets, the same you get for free in the room.... Will I come back? Possible if I have to be around the South West SW London,but it would be a lot better to have meat and a coffee machine on the breakfast.",5-Feb-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"I stayed in this hotel for one night only with my mother in a twin room. The hotel was relatively easy to find and is about 1min walk from the bus stop and about 10-15 min walk from Tooting High Street. I was very happy with this hotel. I was approached very efficiently and I didn't have to wait long before I could go to my room. Upon entering my room I was very pleasantly surprised how nice it looked. The room had tea and coffee facilities, iron and ironing board, desk and TV. The room was very spacious and despite being on the first floor was also very quiet. Free toiletries were also available. The bed was very comfortable and warm and the room also consists of heating which you can self control. Because I don't like the cold I was very happy about the self control heating. I found it a little confusing to use, but after pressing a few buttons got the room to my perfect temperature. The price was reasonably and without a doubt if I'm ever in south London again, I would definitely stay here and recommended others to do so too.

Stayed here for 5 nights whilst on a course. It's very clean and the shower very powerful. Good tv at the end of the bed. Cleaned every day and nice they leave shampoo if you need it and biscuits every day! The room was a bit cold think it was draft from the windows. Stayed on the first floor which did smell of smoke constantly in the corridor despite it being a non smoking hotel. The bed was really comfortable and couldn't hear much noise from other residents; however every time someone came back through the lift the noise when the doors opened is quite noisy. This didn't seem to be a problem if you're a bit further away from the lift having spoken to other people. The breakfast is very basic but sufficient. For the price of the hotel it was much better than I expected and was perfectly fine for my location for the week. I would definitely stay again if I was in Tooting. ,21-Jan-18,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

Also, it was extremely helpful that the hotel had a luggage room for us to keep our bags in as we obviously didn't want to lug them around all day while we out and about around London.The only downside is that at first we were given a room with two single beds so we had to push them together ourselves.

"We stayed for one night on our way through London based on the reviews, the price and the fact that they had air conditioning. The reception welcome was fantastic. The room had a nice decor and the mattress was comfortable, but my 12-year-old daughter who has watched one too many videos on Youtube regarding the cleanliness of airplanes, hotel rooms, etc. noticed that the sheets weren't clean. I was skeptical at first when she told me but we turned on all of the lights and upon inspection she was right! There were several hairs and some stains on the white sheets and also on the bed cover which would have come out with a wash, especially with the use of bleach. The sheets did look freshly pressed but I'm not sure how to explain what we saw. The base boards and floor of the bathroom where nowhere near clean either. And there were various stains on the walls and baseboards of the room. Not the worst room I've seen in terms of cleanliness but clean is clean, right? As we arrived late and it was now past midnight we just dealt with the sheets but my daughter is turning me into a germophobe! We also noticed that the mattress had only one sheet over it with no other barrier between it and the sheet. That's just gross. I think this hotel has potential. The AC worked well on an extremely hot for London day. The doors are thick which contributed to a very quiet stay. The room and bathroom are decorated/outfitted fairly nicely(although there's almost no counter space in the bathroom). But the housekeeping need to step it up big time to earn my recommendation.",21-Jun-17,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

Cant imagine getting much more for the price. I would definitely stay there again. Its a little out of the way requiring a bus ride from the tube station.

"I went to this hotel last year for my job at St. George Hospital. I found it very clean. They cleaned and change sheet and towels every day! It isn't a b&b, but you have a tea pot on the desk in your room,for preparing tea by yourself and some biscuits and ! There is also a restaurant! Anyway I suggest it to who needs of going in St. George Hospital surely, but also to who desires to visit the city because it is to 10 minutes of walk away from Tooting station!",19-May-17,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html
"My review is based on the location / if indeed you have loved ones for an extended stay in St Georges Hospital. You're about a 10 minute walk to the underground. Only 5 minutes to walk to a pleasant pub and Tooting Broadway, which has dozens of restaurants and takeaways. It's a fair location and in real terms, ""a bed for the night"". The hotel is very clean - you get fresh towels daily too. Staff are attentive, efficient and reassuringly always around. There's basic stuff available in the fridge from reception, soft drinks and water. The rooms have decent TV's and are all efficiently air conditioned - Cool or warm, you can easily set for your own comfort. Lift access to all floors, again, very clean - they also have excellent security and cctv covering every floor. Walking distance to the hospital takes just 1 minute - The hospital has a Marcs & Spencer, a coffee shop (great baguettes) and the standard but efficient cafe (breakfast here works). All in all, great value, cleanliness is taken seriously, management care about who they employ - pleasant staff.

"I stayed at The Pelican Hotel over Easter weekend. Our room was lovely, clean, comfortable and had everything you could need. The hotel doesn't any have any facilities but you are near to public transport and shops so you don't need them.

"I was put up here for work, so had no choice. I wish I had insisted on choosing for myself, and it wouldn't have been this hotel. It's in the middle of London suburbia - handy for the St George Hospital, but not much else. There was no breakfast, and no restaurant or snackbar in the hotel. The Receptionist wasn't particularly helpful in suggestions about what was nearby. I suppose none of that is the fault of the hotel, but they could gather together a bit of information about amenities & services in the local area, given that the hotel has nothing except rooms. The room was OK - a tiny bathroom, with a shower only, and a double room that was OK for 1 person, but 2 people would have been very squeezed. The desk wasn't quite big enough to work at, and not enough powerpoints at the desk for all my tech gear. A standard chain hotel room. Good if you're visiting the hospital nearby, but really not for much else.",12-Apr-17,Pelican London Hotel and Residence,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d7182494-Reviews-Pelican_London_Hotel_and_Residence-London_England.html

Our room was spacious and clean with great facilities: tea and coffee making, iron and ironing board, spacious shower with quality toiletries.

"I won't go into the details of the story, but due to travel problems I was stuck in central London in high tourist season and rooms were very scarce. I made a mistake with an online booking and reserved the wrong date: when I came to check-in, the hotel was fully booked.Thanks to the duty manager, Kinga, I was not only able to get a room for the night when another customer cancelled their reservation, but also got a full refund for the erroneous booking. She went above and beyond what anyone could expect to resolve a difficult and stressful situation, even going so far as to call me the next day to tell me about the refund.The room was clean and functional and street noise minimal despite being on the ground floor on a busy street. All the staff were helpful and exuded a positive attitude. The breakfast was a cold buffet but very high quality (and quick to serve for anyone needing to get out of the door in a hurry).I have not stayed at a Point A hotel before but I am now a total convert to the chain and will choose them for future business travel.",11-Jul-19,"Point A Hotel, London Kings Cross St Pancras",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3240599-Reviews-Point_A_Hotel_London_Kings_Cross_St_Pancras-London_England.html

Fatima was the kind soul that I encountered every morning. she was so helpful and was just what I needed first thing in the morning before heading off for my day of work.

We booked for location and price. We knew the rooms were small. However one room out of three was in basement. No windows. THE SMELL OF SEWER AND WORSE MADE ME GAG! I would’ve slept on street before I stayed in this room. I don’t know how the couple managed through the night. But they were there for 8 hours total and went to lobby to wait for rest of us so they could get out of basement room. We believe this room might have black mold. The other rooms were extremely small but we expected this and since close to train station during London MLB series of Yankees and Red Sox we chose to stay one night.

"Room was very small. Even for a couple. The hotel is within a very good location. This is the value. Not bad if you only stay a night.

"First time we have stayed in one of these hotels & I was dubious, but totally unnecessary as it was perfect for an overnight stay prior to our holiday & just up the road from St Pancras.

Small rooms and many of them without windows. Good location. Breakfast enough. Near underground and train station. Kind personal. Expensive but this is a characteristic of london hotels.

I've stayed with you three times now in three years, and each visit, she has stood out! As for the hotel itself, it is clean and safe. Rooms are small, but everything you need is in the room, and design of the space hints at how to live well in tight confines.

I stayed here for three nights alone. It was in a central location to Kings cross Station and also bus stops to get everywhere you need to in London. Staff were friendly and let me check in slightly earlier which was a great bonus. The room is big enough for a short stay and has everything you need. Whilst it isn’t anything fancy it is still clean and does the trick! My only frustration was at night you can hear people coming and going from their rooms but this obviously isn’t the hotels fault! ,24-Jun-19,"Point A Hotel, London Kings Cross St Pancras",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3240599-Reviews-Point_A_Hotel_London_Kings_Cross_St_Pancras-London_England.html
"We spent 3 nights in this cute and modern hotel. Very well located just a very short walk from St Pancras station. Lots of food spots around, great for breakfast/dinner/drinks at night.Very clean and tidy facilities, although there is NO daily cleaning service (might be on request, didn't ask?). Room was great and quite big for a city hotel, also the bathroom very spacious! Make sure to get a room with a window, otherwise it might get quite claustrophobic!!!!! Didn't have breakfast there, but next door at the Water rats (highly recommend this, great food & reasonable prices!!). We've been there for a long weekend and enjoy it very much, could reach all major sights under an hour by foot, covent garden for example only about 25 minutes away!!All in all a very pleasant stay!!",24-Jun-19,"Point A Hotel, London Kings Cross St Pancras",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3240599-Reviews-Point_A_Hotel_London_Kings_Cross_St_Pancras-London_England.html
"It's OK - to good for a quick stay over on business - I would use again if Travel Lodge and Premier are not options. The room was very clean and modern. Staff welcoming 7 mins walk from Kings cross. I think the breakfast is too expensive (£9). For dinner, I eat in the Lucas Arms (opposite)- cheap and cheerful (you would most likely be disappointed - - food does not look like what they advertise on their website. The second night I ate in the Indian restaurant near Kings Cross - this was good. To improve the hotel a kettle, tea and coffee in the room would be nice. Black out curtains are needed.

Rooms were very clean and towels were changed daily at our request, rooms are a lot bigger in person to the pictures. I’ve seen a few reviews about bad checking in and being crowded but that’s like that everywhere and if it’s crowded leave it half an hour, there’s a pub next door! the team, especially Ara, Mehmet and Amina were helpful when we were checking out, getting our bags and chatting to us whilst we waited for a cab.

"My partner and I stayed here last weekend and were a bit disappointed with the staff. The room was nice and clean, the bed was comfy, we couldn't hear any noise from outside which was good as the hotel is so close to the station. However I'd try to avoid the restaurant purely because of the staff, we arrived at 7.30 and was told they didn't have a table for 15 minutes which we were fine to wait, at 8.10 I went and asked if the table was ready and it was (we were literally waiting in the bar for them to let us know but even that was too much trouble for them). When we entered the restaurant we were surprised to see that the restaurant had so many available tables and were confused why we had to wait 40 minutes. We than had to wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order even though I told her when we sat down we were ready to order. and then another half an hour wait for the food to arrive.

stayed for 3 nights with vehicle and found all facilities to be very good.

"We booked into this hotel to go to the BTS concert on Saturday the 1st June. We stayed at the premier inn Wembley stadium on the Friday night and couldn’t get in on the Saturday night as it was fully booked. The hotel on the Friday night was very modern etc and it was a lovely room. I was charged £172 for one night at Hanger Lane which I thought was very steep obviously they charge more when there is concerts on etc. The hotel is on a busy road and there isn’t much beside it also the rooms aren’t as modern as the one we stayed at in Wembley, we couldn’t watch the tv as it didn’t work.

"Although the Hanger Lane Premier Inn is a little way out from the centre of London, its value for money and convenient location made it ideal for us. A short walk via an underpass takes you to the station, which is on the central line and a 20 minute trip to the centre of London.

"On arriving at the hotel I found the car park spaces to be very small, even parked with one side inches from the wall the other side was on the line. Check in was good, on walking to the stairs to the rooms I looked out and saw 4 rats in the car park. Room was ok but TV very small for the distance to the seating. Aircon worked well, bed was comfortable and shower amazing. The restaurant was very good. The biggest disappointment was the internet, I had to pay £5 for the enhanced internet as I couldn't get any pages to load using the standard one. This is inexcusable in 2019, obviously they have sufficient capacity to provide a decent service but expect people to pay for it. The last time I paid for internet in a hotel was 2010 and that was also the last time I stayed in a premier inn.

"We stayed here last week as a base for a three day visit and we were pleased that we had booked outside of the London city area. We haven't stayed at Premier before but we were pleasantly surprised by how good value it was. We managed to find a parking spot and paid £30 for three days, great value.The room was large and bed was good and the bathroom was nice and clean. We requested a fan and this was provided swiftly.We chose to have the breakfast and evening meal deal and the food was plentiful. The breakfasts were very filling and being a buffet it was nice to choose whatever we wanted. I asked the waitress for poached eggs and the chef cooked them for me fresh each morning. I must say a mention to all the staff, who were all very friendly and chatty. The young man behind the bar in the evening was a great example to the hotel. I did ask his name and he told us but I cannot recall it except he said in the south of Italy where his home was his name meant 'happiness' which was what he gave out. Lovely friendly smile and a most polite and welcoming guy. Also the waitress who served us each night. I wish them luck with their futures in the UK. The underground was a couple of minutes away and we had no problems getting around. Next visit to London and we shall stay at this hotel. Great value.

"Good value for money. Affordable price. Wifi a bit slow. Good location. Close to underground. Easy access to central London. Convenience service with car parking.

Just near Hangerlane tube station so easy to get to Central London. Great price. Really friendly staff. Large room was a bit chilly initially but air conditioning is fully adjustable. There's a reasonable number of of parking spaces in the car park at the back (£10 for 24 hours I think) although we didn't use this. ,27-May-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
Good value hotel on the outskirts of London. Close to underground but a bit far from central city. Room was perfect but wi-fi connection a bit slow at times. Buffet breakfast good value but scrambled eggs tasted as though made from powder. Clean and quiet room.,21-May-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
very family friendly. The location is very convenient if your park your car at the hotel for the duration of your stay. The entrance of the Underground ist just outside of the hotel. We always at breakfast about 9am very much at ease.

I stay at Premiere Inns quite often for business and sometimes for leisure. I generally find they are a cut above other hotel chains that cater to business travellers. This one is no exception; a very friendly staff and lovely rooms. The beds are always comfortable and the food inthe Di i g room is good. Or much more that you can ask of a hotel when on business. ,16-May-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"Not much else to say really, everything was great, staff helpful and friendly. Clean, comfortable rooms. Parking available on site (pay when you leave), close to Central line (5mins walk).

I was very pleasantly surprised by the standard and variety of the food on offer at breakfast. The location of the hotel is alongside the busy A40 but it was very quiet in the hotel. The ability to park at the hotel for £10 per 24 hours was also a great help. The hotel is only a 2 minute stroll from the tube at Hanger Lane and 3 minutes from the bus route to Wembley Stadium (483). Also nearby is the Piccadilly line to central London.,8-May-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"Great hotel, it was clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. the upgraded Wi-Fi is not great though; I had trouble connecting to it in the bar, it was slightly better in the room.

"The hotel was excellently located for travel into London being on the Central Line, however I was unfortunate enough to get a room on the A40 side of the hotel and suffered broken sleep from the traffic noise. My parents had a room on the other side of the hotel and experienced no such issues - something to be mindful of if you're a light sleeper!",3-May-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
Situated within easy access to central London staff are very polite breakfast ok but better value if you have kids as they are free so doesn't seem so expensive room a good size and bed comfortable stayed her on a few occasions and haven't been disappointed ,29-Apr-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"Cost:-This was the cheapest out of all the other Premier Inns west of London that we have stayed at before (Brentford, Chiswick, Wembley,Ealing Broadway ), for the dates we wanted, and the third time we have stayed here over several years.Prices fluctuate according to events and demand.Location:-It is at the end of a service road for a parade of shops..quite hairy getting round the Hanger Lane gyratory system especially at rush hour, then a sharp hairpin left off the southbound A406 into the service road. I recommend checking out the google map on their website if you are not familiar with it.There is now a parking restriction 7am to 7pm outside, so we drove in (barrier raises and system remembers your registration even if you haven’t prebooked). £10 a night. Parking spaces were quite tight, especially as a lot of white vans were parked, and we were glad to have parking sensors as there are pillars and kerbs.Reception/Room:-There were 2 people on reception (training in progress I think), and check-in was quick and efficient, and we were given 2 key cards.The room was the usual excellent standard...clean and comfortable. Wi-fi was a bit iffy..had to keep logging in. There was some noise from the room above late at night .which we worked out was gurgling from their shower.Dinner:-We ate and drank in the Thyme restaurant without booking as it was a Thursday and not too busy.The waitress Monika was friendly and efficient. My sirloin steak was tender and cooked as I’d asked, and the peppercorn sauce I ordered as an extra was very tasty. Skin-on chips, mushrooms and tomato all nice. My husband had the cod and chips. Our only observation would be that the plates and food could have been hotter. The disc of garlic butter I’d agreed to and moved from the steak onto the mushrooms never melted. Just as well we were hungry and ate pretty quickly. The menu mentioned a meal deal for 2courses and drink plus breakfast for £24.99...but gave no details. I thought this probably didn’t include steaks, as mine was not cheap,or a large enough glass of wine! (I later discovered this guess was right..a125 ml house wine is included)so we didn’t ask , but I think that details of what meals were available should be displayed with the menu.Breakfast:-We hadn’t booked breakfast as we were meeting friends for lunch in Soho, but decided to go down for a continental breakfast advertised in the room for £6.99 each. On going down we were charged £7.50 each. When we queried this we were told that it must be an old price list in our room. She wrote down our room number, but in spite of putting it on the bin in our room it was returned to the desk, and was there when we left ..see photo (we put it on the bin again). So the “£8.99 full breakfast” next morning was £9.50 each. Having said this, breakfast is always great. I especially like the bacon, black pudding, croissants and coffee.The plates were nice and hot at breakfast..I had to get my serviette from our table to hold it!The hotel could not be more convenient for Central Line tube. It is accessed down a tunnel from the service road. We timed it ..25 mins to Oxford Circus.",25-Apr-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"All the staff were very friendly and helpful, food was excellent as was the service, Hotel was very clean and the rooms were lovely and clean, bed was a little hard but other than that perfect.

"If you are driving to London for a short break, this is the place for you. We put the car in the carpark at 11:00hrs one day and drove off at 15:00hrs the next day - this cost £10!Overall, typical of what you would expect from a Premier Inn with the added bonus of tube location and cheap London parking.

"I stayed here last night whilst working in the area and as always with a Premier Inn it was just the job.No one was on reception when i arrived, but the self check in is very easy now, so no issues at all with that.The wifi was very poor during my stay, so i was forced to upgrade to Ultimate, at a cost of 5 GBP!The following morning i had just got out the bath and walked naked into the bedroom, i was very surprised to see the door wide open and the maid stood there, as there had been no knock at the door whatsoever. Somewhat embarrassing for sure, but I’m sure we’ll both survive.",10-Apr-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"Excellent location & at £93 for 3 nights an excellent price for London. The hotel is a few minutes walk from 2 tube stations, so is ideally placed to get into the city within about half an hour. The area its in is busy but so is everywhere in London, it didn't feel unsafe at night. We didn't sample the food so can't comment on that. The bar was clean & comfortable as was the rest of the hotel. Our room was at the front of the hotel but we couldn't hear any road noise.

"We stayed at this Premier Inn in order to go to the Brighton-Man City game at Wembley arena.When we arrived we had a complication with our room booking (our fault) which was sorted out for us immediately by an incredibly efficient and helpful reception team. In the evening, after our match we walked back from the stadium and arrived to a warm welcome. We decided to eat our evening meal at the hotel and were offered the choice of having it delivered to our room if we wanted to relax in front of the tv. We chose to eat in the dining room however and were served by a top class waitress and waiter who were friendly, polite and efficient. The breakfast team in the morning were similarly as good. We recommend staying here because of the level of service that staff bring. There were a lot of people in the hotel who were visiting Wembley and we felt we really had made the right choice of where to stay. (The stadium was easy to reach on the way there by a direct bus (the 483) from the hotel. For a last minute booking in London we felt that it had been excellent value for money.",8-Apr-19,Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1929257-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Hanger_Lane_Hotel-London_England.html
"Budget hotel which is good for the money but unfortunately we had a bad nights sleep due to noisy people above us and next to us, not the owners fault, very friendly and helpful staff,personally I would say this is a hotel for young people not older people who like to go to sleep at a reasonable time, extra bonus was the cafe downstairs what a hidden gem was the best breakfast I have had in London.",11-Jul-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
This hotel was very noisy at night since we had to leave the window open because there is no air conditioning. The upstairs neighbors were also very noisy late into the night. The staff is nice and welcoming and the rooms are clean but very very small. There are nice outlets for charging phones. The shower water didn’t flow well-was difficult to get the right temperature water. ,9-Jul-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"The hotel is in a nice area of London, many students, coffee shops, restaurants . I had a delicious vegan ice cream across the street, and loved to have breakfast at the Bloomsbury cafe. Delicious coffee and the avocado and egg sandwich on sourdough bread was super. The area is vibrant, The rooms of the hotel are small but the value for money is great. I appreciate that it was so clean. Coming into the showers in the morning was a positive surprise, Very clean and big enough room. Not a problem to share with others. If you like shopping you reach Oxford street after a 30 min walk. The room can be hot in the summer. I closed the window at night since there is traffic on the street. I sleep with earplugs so no problem for me.",6-Jul-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"I was visiting London at the end of a hiking holiday. The hotel is actually a series of buildings converted from homes. I think there may be apartments in some of the buildings. I was in 28 Tavistock Place (as I recall)--in probably the tiniest hotel room I have ever had, with a twin bed, but spotless. The room was ensuite, again, probably the tiniest bathroom I've ever had in a hotel, but also spotless. The staff was really friendly and helpful, and the location is wonderful--a few blocks from Russell Square. I spent all of my time out of the room exploring London, so it was great for me, but probably would not be good for someone expecting to spend time in the room because it was REALLY tiny.",5-Jul-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"Just love this place! The hotel was really easy to find, just a short walk from Kings Cross. Was greeted with a really warm friendly welcome. The room was clean & functional, we had the room with a bunk bed & a double bed. The beds were very comfortable, slept great. As it was a hot evening had the window open all night & didn't hear any noise (room was at the back of the hotel) Was useful that there was a fan in the room also. Loved the old solid furniture in the room and was pleased that proper coat hangers that you can actually take out the wardrobe easily were provided. The bathroom was compact as expected but we were only there a short time. Russell Square tube station is about 5 mins walk away, at night walking back to the hotel felt perfectly safe. Had our breakfast downstairs in the coffee house, was a delicious breakfast. Appreciated the 10% off & a free hot drink voucher. Would definitely stay here again as a brilliant base for a London trip, would recommend to anyone. Just a small bit of feedback, perhaps a headboard could be fitted to the bed? Was quite a large gap behind the bed due to the recess, was a bit difficult to sit up in bed comfortably. All in all, a brilliant place to stay and loved the quirky features. 10/10",30-Jun-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"We've just returned from a 4 night family stay at St Athans and we were very impressed. For this price point and location the standard of the hotel is excellent, high levels of cleanliness throughout the shared bathrooms, common areas and bedroom. The staff were friendly and approachable and the hotel overall had a very cared for feel.The area is excellent, leafy and quite quiet but very close to St Pancras, Kings Cross and Euston stations, and walking distance to the main central areas (we walked to Embankment pier on the Thames for the river taxi one morning and it took about 35 minutes).We stayed in room 17 which has a double, bunks and a single bed; large wardrobe, tv and sink. There was plenty of space for what we wanted, which was just a place to rest our heads after busy days of sightseeing. There are ample shared bathrooms, we never had any issue finding one free at all. There is no bar or restaurant, but the coffee shop on the lower ground floor is open for breakfast and lunch and the hotel has a comfortable and spacious TV lounge, with seating for 6-8 people.The only - very minor - issues were that you had to ring the doorbell to be let in the main door every time, rather than the key cards working here also. I understand this is a security issue but with three young children I don't think there was one occasion where we returned without one at least desperate to go to the toilet so the extra (albeit very short) wait was a little difficult! The other one is that the bedroom window was an original sash window, which opened fully at the bottom. As our youngest child is nearly 6 now it wasn't an issue for us, but might be if you have younger / more prone to adventure children with you!Overall we were hugely impressed and we look forward to visiting again!",1-Jun-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

They could not be more helpful and lovely, especially Fa and Kamil! A great team! I have a single room which had all the facilities you need. There was a sink in the room but the toilet & showers are shared, there are 2 on every floor, they are super clean.

"St Athans provided decent value family accommodation that was walking distance to the main London attractions as well as the St Pancras station to get the train to Paris. To access the room, you needed to walk up a stair case. Our room had a bunk bed with a double bed, while the bathroom was smaller than a cruise ship, with a big step up, where you needed to be careful in using the hot water. The room did not contain a fridge.I appreciated the ability to check in slightly early and luggage store on our departure day as we caught an 8pm train to Paris. After walking around London from early morning, we were also able to relax in the lounge area at the front of the building on return for our luggage before heading to the train to watch tv and use the reading materials. This reinforced my positive impression of the St Athans Hotel.",18-Apr-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"I had a single en suite room which I found suitable for a four-day stay. It was simple and basic, looked and felt clean. My room had quite new bathroom fixtures, a large window looking into the rear (nothing to see, but it let in light and air), a closet with five hangars, and a small and wall-mounted flat-screen TV. There was room on the floor for a suitcase. It would be helpful if there were a hook for a coat or toiletries bag.The location is convenient to many things and quiet. There are no bars close by. There is a separate cafe on the lower level which offers a discount if you stay at the hotel. There is also a cafe across the street with a few more options. On the same block there are restaurants that are quick/cheap and mid-range, as well as a late-night shop for snacks, candy, fruit, wine. The Russell Square Tube station is about a 5-8 minute walk, easy even if you have a larger wheeled bag. We walked to Westminster, Victoria Station and elsewhere, but took the Tube ""home"" at end of day.St. Athans appears to be comprised of a few attached buildings, once homes, but converted into small hotels that are all now under St. Athans. So, after checking in, you may have to go out to the street and down a few doors to get to your room. It feels like a reasonably safe area.",8-Apr-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"Pros:We arrived very late at night and it was not a problem to check in.Affordable. Quiet.Room was clean.Location. Close to tube and Kings Cross Station.Cool neighborhood.Good pre-arrival communication.Cons:Tiny room - the pictures online must have been taken with a trick camera lens because they looked huge. They were not huge. We kept stubbing our toes and tripping over each other.Shared bathroom that was - hopefully? - clean. Light was too dim to be sure. Door locks were not always functional. Treacherous stairs that were extremely difficult to get our baggage up and down. The kids were frightened of falling.Tilted floors that resulted in our feet being higher than our heads - I suppose it’s good for circulation or something.I would NOT want to be in this hotel in a fire! Overall, be sure that your family is prepared for the shared bathroom. We weren’t even there for 12 hours, so it was fine. I would not have wanted to stay for a week.",10-Mar-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"This review is a little unfair on the hotel I know that and must stress this from the start of this review!I booked this hotel through hotels.com and it seemed from the reviews to be close to all the things we needed, it is further from the stations than I would have liked but that's personal preference I prefer to be closer to a tube station.upon arrival I checked in and was taken to my room and the lady explained that I got 10 percent off breakfast from the cafe downstairs and a free coffee (it was clear to me that breakfast was in fact not included) we walked past some steps and the lady (very polite and very friendly) explained to me that it was a shared bathroom, this is my own fault I never saw that this was the case or I wouldn't have booked this in the first place as this is not something that I would ever want. I got to the room and it was very dated and VERY small with a small sink in the corner and I have to say I felt like I was in some kind of a hospital rather than a hotel. I would never have been able to relax here which for me is what I expect from a hotel room. its a real shame as I really dont like to leave negative reviews but from my experience this is how I felt and I really do stress this is my own fault for not doing my research before booking checking location and not seeing that it was a shared bathroom.",10-Feb-19,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"They are very honest about being a basic hotel. But if you want an affordable, clean, lodging in a terrific location, this is a good choice. The pros are location, location, location. Easy to walk everywhere in central London, close to the Tube, and close to many lovely squares, restaurants, shops. It is also clean and the staff is generally very helpful and friendly. The con was about our first room there. For the first week, we stayed in a very small room which was not fun to come home to, and there was a great deal of noise in the hallway as we were close to a door leading into the back area. (I suspect the noise we heard was employees, not other guests, in general). But when we returned after a week away, we were in a larger, quite nice room, in a quiet hallway on the second (their first) floor. So I would advise asking about the room and being sure that it suits your needs. I do recommend it; just ask about the room.",28-Dec-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"200 year-old Georgian houses don't convert well to hotels. Ditto the St Athans Hotel, where I stayed 6 days.I had room 5 on the second floor directly above the entrance and the office. I could hear the front door buzzer all night long. The street noise and people coming and going died down between 4 am and 5. The tiny room and single bed lacked a closet, tv, clock and night stand.

"Stayed here for one night at the end of October 2018. Location as many others have pointed out is excellent, being about 5-10 mins walk from Kings Cross and St Pancras mainline stations and Russell Square tube station. Lots of good historical sites and museums are nearby as well as many highly rated restaurants.My single room on the top floor (servants' quarters of the old house :-)) was warm and comfortable and more than adequate in size for my needs. If you have a big suitcase such as I did, you just need to be careful when navigating the tight stairs to get up to the 3rd floor but it's to be expected when staying in any older house with character. My bathroom was just across the hall, immaculately clean and never had to wait even though the hotel was fully booked that night. The cafe downstairs serves a great Full English breakfast plus a variety of other healthier options.For me though, the highlight of this stay was definitely the staff. Every single employee, without exception, was friendly, attentive and welcoming. Having stayed in many hotels around the world I know how rare it is to find one where every member of staff is smiling and looking like they are genuinely happy to be working there. After checkout, they kindly let me leave my suitcase there while I went to attend to some matters in another part of London. Unfortunately, on my way back, it started pouring with rain and I got completely soaked. However, when I got back to the hotel they were kind enough to let me sit in their lounge and use one of their hairdryers until I managed to dry myself off! Can't beat that kind of service! Will definitely stay there again next time I'm in town.",6-Dec-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"I stayed at the hotel for three nights in an individual room with a shared bathroom. Everyone that worked there was very nice and always willing to help or even just talk.The hotel is really interesting because it is over 200 years old and is a protected building, that is why there's no elevator, they can't ""alter"" a protected building (fun fact I learned from one of the members of the staff). The bathrooms were always clean and I never had to wait because someone else was using it, also, my room had a little sink and a mirror which were very useful as well... The hotel has access to a cafe that serves great beakfast and has a 10% discount. The bed (matress) wasn't the most comfortable but that is okay! I would definitely stay again! When I had to leave Hermo at the lobby helped me figure out how to get to the airport and at what time should I be waking up which was really helpful! thank you",2-Dec-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"Stayed there twice with friends in a 2 week period and had no complaints. Rooms came as advertised, were quiet, tidy, plenty of toilets and showers (shared bathrooms), super safe, great location and friendly staff.

"This is a budget hotel and therefore don't expect anything fancy. Once you accept that you won't go wrong. The location is excellent. The rooms are small but very clean and the mattresses and pillows were very comfortable. It would be an issue for anyone with mobility issues as the stairs are very narrow and steep. The showers are a bit basic (they shower head holder was broke in the one I used so you had to hold the shower head) but they were clean. The staff were lovely. I would definitely recommend it. Also, there is a lovely pizza place a few doors down called Pizza Sophia which we would give a big thumbs up to.",5-Nov-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"I´ve been there for 4 nights late September 2018 and I´ve been surprised. Usually you´ll get what you pay for. And in London this isn´t much. Buch not with St. Athans! It´s clean(!), quiet, comfy and the staff is very nice. The (cheap) rooms are very basic, but you´ll find everything you need... except of TV and electric kettle (you can buy one nearby ;) ). The staff is very friendly and helpful, you can leave your luggage before arrival and after departure w/o any concerns. Loaction is rellay great, it is a 5 mins walk to Russel Square subway or St. Pancras station. There are some nice pubs nearby and also a shopping center where you can get everything you need. Although it´s a busy neighbourhood it´s acceptable quiet at night, you can leave the window open :)Finally, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It´s a hidden gem in London! Nice, friendly, quiet, comfy and affordable.",14-Oct-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
My wife daughter and I just stayed here. This is absolutely a no frills hotel but for what it is it was great for us. We were in London for 2 days and did a ton of sight seeing so all we needed were comfortable beds and a hot shower and were were set. The staff here was great and I would definitely come back. We left London to Paris at St Pancras station and its only a couple of blocks away. Also the restaurant downstairs has an amazing breakfast. ,30-Sep-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"I needed a hotel room at the last minute, but didn't want to spend a lot. I just wanted a place to spend one night. The St Athans Hotel was very clean and comfortable. There was a decent bed, dresser, hangers and a sink in the room. The shared bathroom facilities were also clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The front door is locked at night, and the lobby is monitored 24/7.

"I travel and have traveled around a lot. This was definitely my worst ever experience. From the moment one entered the hotel, there was an atmosphere of chaos and lack of the touch of businessmanship through and through. We got a tiny room at the basement. It was very hot during our stay in London, temperatures reaching upto 36 degrees Celsius.There were no ACs in the room. Nor did the come up with the thoughts of providing table fans in that scorching heat. The keys failed to function to evening in a row. Once, we had to wait long for the person at the reception to show up to fix the keycard. When we talked people at the reception that the hotel could have put up a table fan in some of the rooms, they started finding all kinds of excuses, and were practically rude, too! If you are looking for a youth hostel like creep in places, you might well like this one, too!

"Positives - Spotless clean ensuite bathroom - but very very tiny - water was not hot many a times - Central location - <5 minutes walk from Russell square station - Luggage storage after check-out- Staff tried to be helpfulNegatives- The room smelled bad - The building felt claustrophobic- The linen did not feel very clean - felt a little itchy- No cooling / air conditioning / fan in the room, which is a major concern - Windows in the room were left wide open, at the time of check-in - Did not feel completely safe - No lockers in the room, only a really worn-out cup-board - Poorly lit room The stay was not terrible but I would not recommend the place to anyone.",19-Jul-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"We were looking for budget and close to center. St. Athan's delivered on both fronts. If you are young, not in need of lots of space or great comfort, this hotel is for you. We were traveling as a family of 5 and reserved the family room. It consisted of a bunk bed, a double bed and a single bed in the attic. The floor was slanted, space was cramped and with 5 people in the tiny room it got hot really quickly. Luckily it was early June, can't imagine what it must feel like in late July or August. If you are traveling alone or with 2 people and aren't too hung up on the regular chain hotel amenities, this is a great budget option. Oh, did I mention the toilet and shower were located in the hallway and shared with other guests?",17-Jul-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

This place is centrally located near underground and rail station. Rooms are clean but space a bit tight. We were there during a hot spell. Without fans or air condition it is a bit stuffy unless we open windows which can be a bit noisy. The shower did not drain well and flood to the toilet side. Management was responsive and took care of the problem immediately. The staff is friendly and helpful.,9-Jul-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"This is a lovely little gem of a find.....5 minutes walk from Euston train station and close proximity to central London (20 minutes walk to Oxford Street). St. Athans has really nice helpful staff who happily assisted us with directions to get to places on foot.Our room was clean and cosy, it was in the basement below street level but this didn't matter to us. The only negative is the toilet is up a flight of stairs and the shower room is along the corridor.....again this didn't matter to us as they were available to use when needed.Breakfast wasn't included but we were given ONE voucher for a free coffee (two of us but only one free drink) and a 10% off voucher for the total bill in their little coffee shopAt £100 for the night would definitely come again",8-Jul-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"A very affordable hotel in central London. Was my second time in the city, this time on a cheaper budget. Got there and the “reception” couldn’t find my reservation. I had to go over to the computer and find it myself. I really liked the room. Free WiFi, tv, very cozy and a surprisingly good bed. Clean, but the shower drain was full and it took ages for the water to go away. Me and my wife went out and did the town. Got back and went to bed and that’s when I decided that I would never go back to St Athans. The walls are extremely thin. Stayed on the bottom floor and everytime someone entered the place it sounded like a horde of elephants ran through. You can hear a cough through the entire hotel. I laid awake till 2-3 every night because of it.Cleaning was good but they just skipped over it one of the days. Thanks. When we checked out I asked where we could get a taxi and got the answer “just go out and when you see a cab with a lit taxi sign just wave your hand”. Oh gee, thanks! Never would’ve thought of that. I actually asked because in the room pamphlet it said: “we’ll gladly book a taxi for you”. Guess not.It sounds miserable, I know. The room is still cozy and if you’re on a tight budget I guess you could reconsider St Athans as an option. Although I’m not going back.",22-Jun-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"Clean rooms, excellent staff that is available 24-7. Rooms are secured as well as the front door which can be opened by a staff member. Stairs can be a problem but again, if your bag is heavy, they are ready to help. Shared baths throughout the hotel are checked on a regular basis.

"I didn’t really know what to expect because I’ve never stayed with a hotel like this. It was cozy, had free WiFi, a convenient cafe with great food beneath the hotel for breakfast, and the staff are so, so friendly. I stayed in two ensuite rooms and they were both very cozy with all the basic amenities covered. The hotel is also a short jaunt from an off-license, a laundrette, a bus stop and the Euston train station.

The St. Athans Hotel is in a great location and neighborhood. It is close to Russell Square Tube station and also St Pancras train Station (and tube stop). The hotel is dated but was clean and fairly comfortable. Our room was next to the street and with the windows open it was pretty noisy. The shared bathrooms were also clean and varied from large to small. The staff was friendly and helpful. A very nice cafe is located below the hotel and has good coffee and treats.,1-Jun-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"This is a green hotel and they actively follow the green protocols in servicing their guests. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable about the neighborhood and surrounding areas. Fees were very reasonable. Centrally located in the Bloomsbury neighborhood. Rooms are very small and better suited for single travelers. Bathroom small with tiled step to get out of shower(very slippery). Bed very uncomfortable. Hotel is 200 years old and the dwelling has settled, floors are very sloped. We loved the staff and we loved the area we just didn't like the bed and the shower step. Better suited for a young single person.",9-May-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

"It's a fine place if you know what you are getting. If you are expecting what an American would call a Hotel, that's not what this is. So here's some helpful information for Americans looking at booking this place.Europe has hostels and hotels. This one technically resides in the hotel category because of private rooms, but it feels more like other hostels I've stayed in rather than a hotel. Rooms- are tiny from an American hotel frame of reference. It's fine based on other comparable products in the same category. Do not book this place if you are looking for space. This is room for sleeping and that's about it. Bathrooms-There are private and shared. I had a private bathroom that was within my room. If you are thinking of an American hotel bathroom, that's not what this is. It's a bathroom pod installed at some other time. After all, the building (like most other buildings) is a hundred years old. The pod is the equivalent of a small RV camper bathroom. That's the size. Most RV bathrooms actually have more room around the sink. My 5th wheel camper bathroom was twice as large as the bathroom pod in the room I stayed in. Same materials for finishes. Toiletries-bring your own shampoo, conditioner, and soap. This place doesn't provide those things. My personal experience: Staff was nice. I booked through Expedia and there wasn't enough information for me to make an informed decision and when we arrived I had my wife and teenage girls in one room and I was in another. My girls didn't feel safe and people were coming and going till after midnight. The doors were thin enough that it felt uncomfortable. There's a sense of privacy Americans are used to with hotel doors typically being solid core wood with gap seals so most hall noise is eliminated. That sense of noise privacy did not exist here. Our private bathrooms were not functional for our needs. The bed I slept in had a support right down the middle of it and the mattress was very basic so every time I turned on my side the support bar was on my hip and caused pain. I hope they fix that bed. I couldn't sleep that night. One other major odd thing was a painted cast iron plumbing pipe that came down in the corner of the room and you could hear water coming down when people used the bathroom. All in all-the other reviews didn’t properly convey what I should expect. It just was not up to our basic standard for accommodations and I booked another place the next morning and we left. The manager wouldn’t refund any money which was prepaid for a week long stay, and I lost over a thousand dollars by booking this place without a clear understanding of what I was getting into. The reason he gave was that we didn’t give him a chance to rectify our dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, there was no way to do that since it would’ve required a major construction remodel. Nothing against his hotel. It was just not what I was expecting. It sucks to lose that much money on a vacation, but I hope this review is helpful for Americans who, when they read the word “Hotel” and have a certain expectation, recognize this is not what we in America consider a hotel.",14-Apr-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

You have to use shared bathrooms but these are clean and plentiful. There is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room however it is a friendly and comfortable place to stay and the café in the basement does lovely breakfasts and you get a free drink there.

"During my fifteen-night stay in the St. Athans hotel, I was fairly pleased most every day. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, is a very friendly group of people that is always helpful and accommodating. The hotel itself is located perfectly, providing the feeling of a big city without the chaos of some other, more densely populated parts of London. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, and the British Museum is only a ten or so minute walk from the hotel. Additionally, the Russell Square and St. Pancras/King's Cross stations are both a few minutes away on foot. The rooms of the hotel are nice, but I can only speak to the more communal rooms (four and three beds). Our room had a little sink and mirror in it, but the toilets and showers are communal, and located in the stairwells. It was a little bit cramped for three people staying in one room, but nothing too bad. The beds are quite comfortable.Now for the less favorable aspects of the hotel. There is a system in place that requires all guests ring a doorbell to enter the hotel. This is an understandable security measure, but it can get a bit annoying (for the staff as well I am sure). As I mentioned before the communal bathrooms, while not a dealbreaker for me, may be difficult for others. There is also no breakfast offered with the hotel, but it is connected to a nice coffee shop (with a discount) that is convenient and tasty. Overall, the good definitely outweighs the bad, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I would also recommend for those that would like a convenient hotel in London that is affordable, friendly, and clean.",25-Jan-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html
"Firstly the location is Russell Square, a street away from the tube, 10 or so minutes walk to Euston main railway station and about 20 minutes or so to the Eurostar. If needed the No 91 bus around the corner will take you to Trafalgar Square.The hotel is old, no lift so ask before booking if a ground floor room is available if stairs are of a concern. There is a café in the basement well worth a visit for a coffee or meal. Most rooms do not have a toilet but one or two so ask again before booking.But the main reason is the rooms are clean, staff very helpful and the rates are excellent for those on a budget and the location is excellent.",5-Jan-18,St. Athans Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d628205-Reviews-St_Athans_Hotel-London_England.html

She is a little bundle of joy with a smile that lights up the room and such a sweet and genuine nature – a definite asset to the team.Food in the restaurant was excellent and plentiful both for breakfast and our A-La-Carte dinner on Saturday.

I just had to come on site and review this spectacular luxury yacht hotel.It was top class. My bedroom was massive more of a suite and luxurious. The bed was super comfy and lots of elegant wardrobe space. The bar lounge was superb and on the warm evening that it was you could go out on deck and sit overlooking the docks and the 02. Very relaxing. The staff were excellent and highly professional especially the bar area manager. The reception staff were warm friendly and very professional. The breakfast manager was very professional and courteous and my eggs Benedict was second to noneAll in all it was a very enjoyable stay and superb value for money,7-Jul-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

Reception was very helpful in directing us to nice places in central London, so we have great day out as well. We tried food room service as well and in 20 min was delivered to our room!

"Visited the Sunborn for afternoon tea with my Dad. We were staying overnight at Novotel Excel 1 minute away (excellent hotel btw) so probably better staying there given the not so good reviews on the yacht's accommodation ....???Our afternoon tea was definitely one of the best we have had. Very fresh sandwiches, lovely warm scones and beautiful desserts. Totally delicious, sadly we couldn't finish it all !! Waiters were very pleasant and attentive.The foyer and beautiful staircase up to the Lands End restaurant were immaculate.The restaurant itself again was immaculate, beautiful white linen.Great place to enjoy tea or whatever. Would visit againThe only thing that spoils the docks in our opinion is the rather ugly black iron cranes.... understand why they're there but maybe too many of them ?

Booked an executive king room which was delightful..spotlessly clean with large comfy bed and great veiws of the Thames from the balcony.Spent a delughtful afternoon sipping cocktails on the deck served by a lovely phillipino little waitress who couldn't do enough for us.Weather was superb ..which helped..but bar area was lovely so would not have been a problem if not.Delicious sandwich ordered..big enough for two to share..yes..pricey..but hey ho you don't book to stay here and expect it to be anything less.We had a delicious set menu 3 course meal in the restaurant..again..the staff were delightful..and a lovely breakfast from the buffet the next morning which had a great choice.Something for everyone.Overall..a great stay. ..well worth the money for a special occasion or treat..really cannot understand the poor reviews on here..We would go back without hesitation.Well done Sunborn..big thumbs up from us.Thank you.,3-Jul-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"It's in a great position in the Docklands, easy to get to the O2 across the water or into Canary Wharf or into central London. We had booked a standard room but were very lucky to be upgraded to a room with a balcony which was lovely. Very spacious room, I think the same size as the the standard but those rooms only have a small porthole.Was so nice in the morning sitting on the balcony watching the runners go past and seeing London wake up.We didn't eat on board so can't comment on the food. Had drinks in the bar at the end of the evening which was expensive. We didn't stay long as there was a noisy crowd who were quite drunk and kept chasing their child around the bar! Not the hotels fault of course!Overall nice hotel in an excellent and peaceful part of London.",3-Jul-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Me and my husband £570 to stay here for 2 nights on wednesday 26th june for our 1st yrs wedding anniversary, upon arrival we were told that we still had 5mins untill check in so we went to the bar, the barman told us to take a seat as it was table service, after waiting 15mins i decided to collect my drink myself only to be told they didnt have my husbands drink and we was to choose something else, overall it took about 30mins to be served even though there were only 6 people in the bar at the time.The drinke were ridiculously overpriced with an added service charge. When trying to check in AGAIN we were greeted by a miserable,rude young lady called Ilona who then informed us that as we didnt have the card we had booked and paid on (altough payment was made days prior and booking confirmed) we wasnt allowed to stay and there was nothing she can do! she needed that exact card! so if you have been bought this trip as a gift im assuming you will need to bring the payees card with you?? on booking this there was nothing to say that bringing that card was complusary. Luckly enough for us we only lived the other side of the water so was able to get a black taxi home to collect the card which cost us £50! cant imagine how anyone travelling from afar would be able to do or afford to do this. eventually 2hours later we eventually checked into our room, after walking down the hallway with the worn out rippled carpet that tripped me over our bathroom had hair all over the floor. The balcony with sea view that we paid extra for was tiny i could just about cross my legs without grazing my knees, with 2 cheap garden furniture chairs to sit on, and when u did u couldnt see the sea only the sky as the chairs were low down. Its so close to the city airport, at first watching a plane go past so close was amazing untill we realised it was every 5 mins and was so loud you had to stop conversation untill the plane had past, this was from morning untill late.EVERY 5 MINUTES!! The room was big but not luxury, the cleaner left our dirty coffee cups and spoons after making up our room and left our room with 1 tea bag. Breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, cheap bacon, had plenty of breakfasts like this in alot cheaper accommodation, wasnt worth the upgrade! Toilets in bar and reception were clean but the only time the sink water worked was when you turn on the bidet hose in the cubicle?? Some Staff were rude, some had very strong accents and were hard to understand, The only thing thats luxury about this Yacht is the stair case, it was beautiful,gives you the impression on arrival that you are stepping into a luxury, classy hotel but the rest of this hotel is standard and feel we wasted our money. The website for Sunborn is terrible, only promoting the spa and wont allow you to do anything direct with them, i didnt get to use the spa as you have to book via reception who had no clue as to prices and info etc, i was told that reception would call them and the spa would call me back at somepoint, when they did i was told the therapist had been working and was tired and could only see me at 9am the morning i was leaving. When checking out i was asked how my stay was, i explained that i was far from happy and the duty manager refunded our breakfast cost and our overpriced bar bill for 2 drinks which we waited ages for and got something compleatly different anyway which altogether came to £78...£50 of which wouldve covered our taxi bill home to collect our bank card, so to be honest wasnt much compensation for all the inconveniance we had! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone unless you have money to burn and are not expecting to much in return.",1-Jul-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"First approached the boat and it looked lovely. Only way to gain entrance to boat is via the lift, I have bad anxiety of enclosed spaces. I had to wait to be let in the fire exit.i think this should be explained on booking. On booking I was told my card would be held the amount 48 prior and payment could be made on the day. They took the payment in full instead 48 hours before, even though I explained at the time of booking I had a £200 gift voucher to use. I now have to wait 3-5 days for a refund back to my card. In the Bar we waited 25 minutes for chips, asked for mayo and was given empty used jars from another table by the waiter. Service in restaurant was poor, waited 20 minutes for them to take our dinner plates. Explained at check out when asked if we had a good stay, receptionist not interested. Bar and restaurant add 12.5% discretionary tip to everything. How they can justify that with such poor service is beyond me. Not worth the money at all.",30-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"After booking this hotel for my Parents for a Christmas present, and for an engagement gift for my sister, we decided to go and stay ourselves after recently having a baby. I tried to book direct on the sunborn website however a box kept coming up for me to enter a draw for a spa break (sunborn promotion not a random advert) despite continually clicking continue browsing it kept coming up. I decided to then book via Expedia. Later on that evening I looked at the hotel for things to do on my iPad (the contine browsing worked this time) and I noticed you get benefits for booking direct, such as 10% of food bill, and upgrades if available. I emailed sunborn and advised I booked via Expedia (it was £3 cheaper despite sunborn promoting they offer the cheapest rates). I explained my issue, and that this was a treat & asked whether they could honour the loyalties or would I need to cancel and rebook. The response back, “no we are unable to honour this & as you booked a non refundable rate with Expedia you won’t be able to cancel”. I found this so frustrating as we were going to eat onboard, but knowing I could’ve saved left a bitter taste in our mouths! I mean I only saved £3 by booking elsewhere & did contact immediately to explain! I have spent over £700 with sunborn this year! The hotel is lovely & the staff are very friendly but due to the poor service on my booking this will be the last time.",28-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Great location and great service, felt really well taken care of by Salomey for afternoon tea. Food was more than ample for us and we were asked if we wanted more!

"Extremly dissapointed this was a wedding gift to me and my new wife from my mother in law on arrival we were greated by the most miserable bunch of staff i have ever witnessed we where then asked to pay a £40 charge of a card justvas a deposit incase of any damages etc this was fine but will return to this later , after getting our key we walked down the worn out hall into our room which looked nice ,my mother in law had asked the staff before we had arruved for an upgrade as it was a special wedding gift there was no sign of this apart from 4 small chocolates on table with a letter of what time breakfast was etc, even just a simple cingratualtions from your missrable staff would of been nice , any off to the bar we went just to be ripped of since when does it cost £9 for a draft beer , after this we decided to go out as would be cheaper seeing as this was supposeed to be a nice relaxing night on tge yaught we are now at the o2 arena having a few drinks . So in the morning i have a bit of a stomach cramp which had day before so didbt go for breakfast and my wife had a slice of toast which we were informed was included in the price , turns out that this is what the £40 deposit was for at checking in , after much discussion at reception explaining i didnt go for breakfast and my wife had a slice of toast are you reallt charging £39 for there reply was well yer , the resturant is open till 11 if you want more what a absolute joke this place is i will be posting this message on as many sites as i possible can.",24-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"I didn't quite know what to expect as I had never heard of a ""Yacht Hotel"" before, but I was very pleasantly surprised.The size of our classic room was unexpectedly generous. The queen sized bed was very comfortable and the nautically themed decor was aesthetically tasteful. As our room was below deck, the only reminder of being on water once actually on board was looking at the river view from the restaurant. The staff were helpful to the nth degree and nothing was too much trouble.The breakfast was absolutely delicious and you could eat your fill.My only bugging issue was the key card that is also supposed to operate the lift. It was very temperamental; in the 2/3 days we were there we had to get it re-programmed 3 times this was somewhat inconvenient. Other than that we enjoyed our stay very much. We'd like to try Sunborn, Gibraltar next!",21-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

Fantastic night aboard this beauty with great views across the Thames. Breakfast excellent. We traveled with a local coach company Vision Tours. The cabins were very spacious even bigger than a lot of Hotel rooms.,16-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Some months back I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for myself. I read the reviews before booking & they were mostly positive, but the closer to our stay there were a few more negative ones & I did begin to wonder whether I would be disappointed. I needn't have worried, I can honestly say we had a fabulous stay & did not have any of the problems others have posted about, such as noise & poor customer service. Check in was quick & simple, the young woman on reception was very welcoming & efficient, in fact every member of staff we encountered was friendly & helpful.We stayed in an Executive King Room with river view. The room was spacious & spotlessly clean, with a small balcony, sadly we didn't get to use the balcony as much as I would have liked because of the awful weather but the main thing the room was so quiet & peaceful.We did not eat breakfast on the boat, as I felt £20 a head was rather a lot in view of the fact I need gluten free food & probably would not be able to eat much of what was on offer. We did however eat dinner on board on the night of my birthday, my husband checked with the restaurant with regard to my need for gluten free food and the staff could not have been more helpful. We had a wonderful meal which we both thoroughly enjoyed and fantastic service from our lovely waitress Neringa. Thank you, you made my birthday meal memorable.So all in all we loved our stay at this hotel, we have recommended it to friends, who have already booked for August and we hope to return in the not too distant future ourselves.",15-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
Why do hotels like this think they have the right to make up pathetic excuses as to why something happened when you make a complaint?I made a complaint yesterday morning as to why the reception staff let several people queue jump in front of me. Apparently the reason is that they have no control over queue jumping and the unwelcoming reception staff are happy to let that happen. So if you are going there just go straight to the reception desk by passing anyone that appears to be queueingMy compensation for my inconvenience was a late check out but I was told by email at 10:30. That was the time I left the room. Nobody could be bothered to phone me in my room the evening before. Secondly my advice is not to have breakfast there. Everything is bland and if you like several cups of tea or coffee you will be up and down as you can only get single cups. Better to go to Starbucks near the station if you want decent coffee. I go this hotel several times a year but the customer service and cutbacks are getting worse. The rooms are great but a hotel can’t be judged on the rooms alone.,14-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"An opportunity to try something a little different. The public areas of the boat are very attractive. The room was well appointed, clean and spacious and benefitted from a balcony where it was possible to sit. Shower room small but has everything you need. Very comfortable bed and quiet despite aircraft taking off from or landing at nearby London City Airport. Located next to the Excel and about a 5 minute walk from DLR where it takes about 30 mins to reach central London. Ideal if you like the contrast of being able to get away from frenetic central London to somewhere a bit more relaxed.

Great location for excel conference and for O2. River views give you amazing views of Canary Wharf and planes taking off from city airport - noise wasn’t an issue though. Didn’t try the rather overpriced breakfast and eat elsewhere but the room itself offered great ‘cruise’ style accommodation. Decor a little dated but clean and in good condition. Would stay again - better that an identikit hotel room for same value. ,8-Jun-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

"Stayed here for one night whilst watching a show at the O2. Great location and easy access to the Emirates cable cars (note cable cars stop at 10pm so you have to use tube and dlr to get back if after 10pm). Room very spacious particularly for London, amenities very good and check in easy. They take a £40 deposit on your card which is a bit of a cheek but you get it back if you do not use it.

"Location is pretty good especially if you want Ex Cel. Our room was good although no Sky T.V. It had a balcony and a very good shower - but no bath which upset my wife. Had lunch in the bar area - this was very nice - and we were well served by the friendly bar staff. Dinner was not such a great experience - mainly because I think they were understaffed. The starter was tasty - a ham terrine - but it was advertised with sour dough and that wasn't on the plate when they brought it. It was impossible to catch a server and when I eventually got a senior staff member they offered to send it out - but I had finished. The mains - rib eye - was O.K. but the jus had a very funny taste. The restaurant did, however, offer very acceptable wine by the glass. So a mixed bag. I enjoyed my stay but see no reason to repeat it .",31-May-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"When we arrived to check in, there was a business convention taking over almost all of the yacht. We were unable to go out on deck or use the bar. This made us feel very unwelcome and confined to our room. We were also not told anything about this at check in. The room was lovely and spacious, with my only complaint being that our double bed was two singles pushed together which wasn't that comfortable.There were occasional slams from room doors and a fair amount of stomping from people above but that isn't the hotel's fault.The food was excellent and the staff were friendly.Our only negative experience in the bar was staff taking 15 minutes after seating us to take out drinks order, and a further 15 minutes to bring them over.The location is very convenient for events at the hotel.It would be great if the hotel had additional facilities such as a gym/sauna/steam room/jacuzzi.",26-May-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"My daughter and I treated ourselves to a night in this beautiful yacht hotel. The decor is stunning, the rooms are beautiful. We had ordered a family room which had a king size bed and a sofa bed. I am quite slight and slept on the sofa bed. Sadly this was one of the most uncomfortable and sleepless nights I have had. Staff put up the bed but one of the legs started to collapse in the middle of the night! Sadly we were unable to use the bar as a massive party of hundreds was in progress. There was a makeshift bar for residents but party goers spread there too. I would however like to thank and praise the staff who were having to cope with all these somewhat rowdy drunk people. They were remarkable despite being under great stress. Well done! I suppose it was just bad luck that we had chosen this one night to treat ourselves, but I will not be going back as very disappointed.

My family visited the Sunborn London for the first time for afternoon tea and we were greeted by the delightful Salomey who was informative about the menu. She and her colleague Alisha made our experience there memorable and ensured to include our little toddler in the afternoon delight. Not forgetting the chef themselves who provided us with consistency in the production of the unforgettable scones and miniature desserts. The whole experience exceeded our expectation that we will definitely being returning sooner with more family members.

"2 rooms, one for me, another for my business partner, stayed for 5 nights.The Good... Two of the bar staff were great, Akkash and another chap (can't remember his name, on the same shift). Engaging, efficient and looked like they enjoyed working there. Breakfast on one of the mornings was good. Housekeeping were friendly & unobtrusive. Reception staff greeted with a smile.The Bad... The rest of the bar staff looked like they HATED being there. Getting a drink was a chore, frustrating & expensive. I kind of expect more than a miserable reluctance to be served, or even for asking for the bill. OMG the breakfast is not a great experience either... who cooks sausages on ONE side only, pink in the middle? Butter only on selected tables, plates whisked away immediately after your last bite, the worst toaster ever... and did I mention the half cooked sausages? The Ugly... Why oh why did they remove the luxury champagne coloured carpet in the rooms? It was literally LOVELY and a major selling point. My room had an industrial blue coloured carpet for some reason, my business partner described his room as ""lino & laminate""! With rooms, food and bar tab, our stay cost us about £2.6k. Massively disappointed. Not value for money. There are other places nearby that are cheaper and better.",19-May-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Went for an afternoon tea which was very good, lots of scruffy food and endless cups of tea. Situated near The EXCEL centre London so not the easiest place to get to. However well worth the effort.

I had one of the most basic rooms and it was very spacious and comfortable. It was dock facing and level 1 but still was above the water line. Breakfast wasn't included so can't comment on the food.

"Just returned from our fourth visit to the Sunborn Yacht and although the rooms are fine, clean and roomy ad always, what has happened to the breakfast? Limited choice of cereals, the cooked breakfast was at best lukewarm the fried eggs were rubbery resembling ones you used to be able to buy from a joke shop! I can't imaging how long the whole thing had been in the so called warmers to be in the state they were.We arrived at breakfast at 8am so perhaps they were cooked at 6.30am when breakfast were first served. Not only was the food terrible, since we last visited they have stopped serving fresh tea and coffee, you now have to collect your own from an urn, which by the taste of the tea bad been standing as long as the breakfast...stewed tea and tepid food, not good enough.At the price you pay for a nights stay I expect far more than this. Will we be visiting again I am not sure, there are far cheaper places near by who would do far better, perhaps the Sunborn Yacht have become very complacent?",7-May-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

"We booked afternoon tea here on a Saturday afternoon and had a lovely day!The drinks and then the tea took a little while to arrive but I suspect that's because they make them to order given that we made some slight changes to what we wanted. The hot chocolates were lovely as they were a cup of hot milk with a large chocolate stirrer. I've not had one of those anywhere other than at home before and it was delicious.The sandwiches were lovely, the scones were still warm and the cakes were perfect and all very fresh. We ordered extra sandwiches because we were all so hungry!When the waitress was pouring our prosecco she was chatting and asked us why we were there. Said we were celebrating a belated birthday and then the conversation moved on.At the end of the tea, she surprised us by bringing a large piece of delicious sticky toffee pudding with happy birthday written into a decorative chocolate. I was so impressed with this as she had just picked up on the birthday comment and done it off her own back. I think that extra touch really showed a flair for customer service and passion for her job plus a company that allows their staff to make decisions and I always admire that.We then moved into the bar area and spent another 4 hours drinking cocktails.Our experience was ruined slightly by an unreasonable family sitting next to us who were having issues checking in and were arguing loudly with the manager. They were making self-important statements about how much power they had at work and how much business they would move from the hotel and saying things such as 'I work in the hospitality industry'...generally just being a pain and also swearing which was unpleasant. The management team seemed to deal with them very well and resolved the situation.We ended up spending around 6 hours in total and all felt well looked after and relaxed. I wouldn't hesitate to return!",5-May-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

The charge alot and looks good but its just a shell. You walk in and there is a strong cleaning smell to hide. The key in the elevator never works.Cold rooms with only 19 degrees.

"Stayed here on a trip taking my sister to a concert at the o2. While the location was exactly what we needed, unfortunately this is where the niceties ended. Upon arriving your greeted with the charming ""everything's an inconvenience"" attitude of the reception staff. You head down to your room where you can enjoy your tired looking furnace of a hotel room (I set the ""aircon"" to 10... yes 10 degrees and the room temperature after 6 hours of being on had risen to 27 degrees). The hotel is a novelty and sadly that's all it really is. This is the 3rd time I've stayed here and the will definitely be the last. Each time I've been greeted by the same unwelcoming staff, overpriced room and bar rates and bog standard hotel rooms. The tablet in the room is frozen so you cant use it. What a waste of £170!

A lovely little treat of chocolates for the birthday girl was a nice touch.From the first steps to the rooms and everywhere inbetween was very clean and tidy and it looks extremely grand.Our rooms, classic river view, were large and comfortable.The nearest DLR station is custom house and you need to follow signs to the Excel centre rather than ""way out"".The only negative is the rather over the top prices in the bar for spirits, £9 a shot, mixer on top as well, is more than a little steep and uneccesary.Overall we loved our stay though and will definitely be back.",18-Apr-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Stayed here for One night. The hotel I thought was lovely. Really comfty bed, very clean, staff all working really hard.We got a really good price on room so was surprised how nice it was.We had a private bar for a party and the bar bill nearly gave me a heart attack. Probably the most expensive drinks in hotels I have stayed in.Only 1 of the 2 lifts were working and the one that was, was really slow due to the amount of people sing it.Breakfast was really nice too.",10-Apr-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
We had an ok time here for a two night stay in London. The bed was comfy but the boat is starting to feel it’s age. Clean and tidy but quite far out unless you are visiting the Excel. The staff are friendly enough and the bar area is ok but I’m not sure why they charge a 12.5% service charge to deliver your drink some 25 feet. ,8-Apr-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"We stayed for 2 nights and overall had a unique and enjoyable experience. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, room was large and clean. Great views of Canary Wharf, especially from bar on a night. Food in Bar was great, snacks etc. Only downside was our trip coincided with a large group of loud undesirable people who had loud brash cars which they enjoyed revving. Luckily this event only happens once a year. This hotel is far too good to accommodate this type of clientele!! Would recommend for something a bit different in London.",7-Apr-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"First time staying on a boat!Room was decent, larger than typical hotel rooms in London. Breakfast was sufficient.Toilet was smaller than expected, but considering that this is a boat.... The room I was in had a mini balcony/deck with seats. Got to enjoy a cup of coffee every morning on the deck and see the sun go up.Hotel had a couple of supermarkets in the vicinity, and is right beside ExCeL. If you're there for an exhibition, would recommend!!",4-Apr-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

"I booked the spa and afternoon tea through one of the discount websites. To be honest I didn't check trip advisor which is unlike me, so coming closer to our booking I was really nervous. The spa treatment was a back massage and facial. It wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't the best. The treatment rooms were clean and well presented. However, there was no sink so the therapist had to leave the room to wash her hands. The room had windows and even though the blinds were closed, it was still quite bright. The walls were very thin so conversations in the next room could be overheard. The massage and facial were ok. I asked for very firm but felt too much pressure was applied to my bones which is still painful. My daughter had the opposite experience and said her treatment was fine.The afternoon tea was booked for just after our treatment. However when we got to reception we were advised that the restaurant didn't open until 12.30. Reception contacted the restaurant manager who came up and apologised that they had not received the email with the booking. However as the restaurant was not open, we could have a drink on the house until the restaurant opened. As soon as the restaurant was open we were promptly collected and seated. We were offered a choice of hot drinks and given the menu. We were served by Salomey. Neither of us eat red meat or cheese so the sandwich selection was limited as the only thing we would eat was the salmon. Despite this Salomey said she would check with the chef whether they had chicken or turkey. She returned with chicken and salmon sandwiches. They were to die for. The afternoon tea included mini scones, bakewell tarts, brownies, pannacotta and macaroons. Everything tasted great and was one of the best afternoon teas I've had. The tea was freshly brewed leaves hot and plenty of substance, not the weak watered down rubbish that seems to served in most places. Champagne was also part of the deal but as we didn't have it, Salomey spoke to the restaurant manager and asked if our bottled waters that were not included in the voucher could be substituted. She was a great waitress, friendly, helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Thanks to both her and the restaurant manager for making what would have been a disappointing experience more than positive. The hotel is in a great location, is attractive and the staff we came in contact with were all pleasant. I would definitely go back and would also love the opportunity for an overnight stay.",30-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a business trip. The cabins are pleasant although a little dated, the beds are comfortable and it’s lovely staying riverside to open up onto the deck with great views. Reception staff are very pleasant, however the services levels with the restaurant and bar fall well below expectations and staff adopt a couldn’t care less attitude. The restaurant can’t accept more than 10 covers at any one time due to the size of the kitchen. I saw numerous residents turned away because of this reason. What type of hotel cannot offer reasonable restaurant facilities for its guests? Breakfast costs £20 for full and £15 for continental. Completely overpriced for self service with limited breakfast items. There is more fruit choice in my supermarket lunch box than what the hotel offered. Also, only 1 x 4 slice toaster available at breakfast time with constant queues. Various residents complaining it was unacceptable. After eating elsewhere one evening we returned to the hotel bar to be told it was closed - even to residents! Staff constantly apologising for the shortfalls. I was hoping for a great experience, but it was a disappointment.",27-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Me and my friends had afternoon tea here a few days ago. It was a bit disappointing to find that afternoon tea had gone up £5 each since our booking made in January. Nobody got in touch to advise of this. £25 service charge was also added to the bill, which was wavered for us in light of the above mentioned situation.Afternoon tea was ok, to be honest ive had better for half the price.The yaught is lovely, and definitely a nice experience. But sadly i wouldnt return. Its very pricey for what it is. ",22-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

Good value from booking.com location is where we needed it to be. Unfortunately someone put drinks on my room bill but the staff sorted that out. They should always use both lifts for access there was some lengthy delays waiting to get on & off the boat. ,20-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"We tried Sunborn for a different kind of hotel experience and we weren't disappointed. Our package included an executive double room, dinner for two and breakfast. The large room was fantastic with a polished wood finish to all the walls and furniture. It felt very grand. We had a small balcony with a view over the water to the far side of the dock. We found the room modern, stylish, very clean and equal to any 5 star hotel that we've stayed at previously. It was only the weather (poor) that prevented us from enjoying ourselves out on deck. The main stairway is quite elaborate and stunning and is clearly the central feature inside the yacht. Our dinner was excellent, with scallops followed by fillet steaks and cheese boards (1 each). All the food was fresh and cooked to perfection. The cheese boards had the biggest variety and largest pieces of cheese we've ever received on cheese boards - each board contained more than sufficient for two people. Breakfast was buffet style and once again offered a good variety of cooked, cereal and continental style food. We found service to be excellent and will be back again in warmer weather.",20-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html
"Upon entering the hotel I was kind of underwhelmed at the decor. The lifts were a pain as you had to put your card in the slot to enable the lifts to work and the card reader was playing up slightly, so time wasted playing around with the slot was irritating. The cabin was how a cabin would be expected to look with wood furniture. The bed was UNCOMFORTABLE and the pillows were lacklustre, I'd say that the beds and pillows in a Premier Inn were much better. The bathroom needed updating in my opinion. We decided to go to the bar area behind reception which was the only place open for a drink as the bar terrace upstairs was closed. The bar area was kind of underwhelming. I fancied a coffee and cake but was told that they only had a couple of muffins left over from breakfast so I had one of those. The coffee arrived and was luke warm.We drank our drink and sat there feeling that the common areas could be updated somewhat.Luckily we were going out to eat that night and managed to find an escape room nearby to do as couldn't have sat in the bar all evening.Breakfast was again underwhelming not a very good selection and was luke warm.Overall the whole experience left us leaving kind of deflated and seems like an effort to even write this review as the whole thing seemed very how would I say normal ! I think for this place to sell itself as an executive accommodation they need to seriously upgrade or have a look at the reviews written and think about their marketing.",18-Mar-19,Sunborn London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6603498-Reviews-Sunborn_London-London_England.html

"My partner and I stayed at the Captain Cook during the first week of May 2019. We could not have been more impressed with the experience. Tom and Jack, who run the pub, were incredibly kind and hospitable, and the entire staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. The pub itself is warm and inviting, and the food is some of the best we've had in London. We felt as though this became our second home while we were in the UK.

Check in was friendly and efficient and we were shown to our room and the facilities explained to us.We had room 2 which was spacious, comfortable, and with en suite facilities. The pub itself was busy however you cannot hear it from the room. We spent the evening in the bar and both had very enjoyable meals. My husband had the burger which is huge and he said was excellent. My steak was very tasty but if I return I would have the burger.

"I booked a room here for one night for my son and I as we were going to the football at Stamford Bridge. What a find it was too. Where most hotels were quoting almost £200 for the night I paid £88 for a room here and it was brilliant. The room was enormous, beautifully decorated and well furnished with a Smart TV, Nespresso coffee maker and bottled water. The bathroom was separate to the bedroom but was private for our use only, was again really nicely decorated and very clean. We didn’t eat here so I can’t rate the food from personal experience but what I did see / smell looked amazing! The pub was a 15min walk from Fulham Broadway which was perfect for us and we were really pleased with the location and the value for money it offered. The staff are really helpful, friendly and welcoming and check in presented no issues at all. I’d definitely stay here again and would recommend for anyone looking for a value for money stay which provides easy access to Central London.

"I stayed at The Captain Cook on a Monday night in November on my way through London, and it was an excellent stay. From Heathrow, I took the Tube (Piccadilly Line) to the bus (211), which stops very close to the pub (150 meters or so). The trip took about 50 minutes, including transfer at Hammersmith Bus Station. Arrived early (12:30), which was not a problem at all. Walked into the pub and greeted warmly by the barman, who escorted me straightaway upstairs to my room. I had booked the superior deluxe room, which was more than large enough. Very clean, well-appointed with comfortable bed and adequate bathroom facilities en suite. The wifi was a little spotty, but not a huge problem. I was a little worried about that there would be a lot of noise from the street as the room overlooked Dawes Road, which is fairly busy, but this turned out not to be a problem. As it was a Monday night, the pub was quiet as well; I did not go there for food/drink. I plan to return soon, and will grab a pint downstairs this time.All in all a very good stay, and although I had limited interaction with the staff, it was quite positive. I'm also a big fan of the Fulham neighborhood, as it's convenient to Heathrow but not smack in the middle of the tourist area of London. As I mentioned above, I plan a return visit.",18-Mar-18,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html

"Hopefully my review will make up for my cheesy title. Captain Cook is a lovely, hidden bistro just passed the heart of Fulham. We were instantly seated, welcomed warmly and then a member of staff came over to explain that we are eligible for a 90 minute free flowing prosecco brunch. For the price of the deal, we were worried (but accepted) that we would have a very limited menu but we were offered a pastry and then a variety of breakfast choices or hearty main meals. The staff were attentive and were constantly topping up glasses when they saw they were at the half way point. The food was lovely-I had a fresh, almond pastry and a full English, which was DELICIOUS. I would recommend Caprqin Cook to family and friends and I would definitely go back for their prosecco brunch-with or without a great deal.

"Had another 3 day stop in london on my way home back to australia. Once again i was looking fora place in Fulham. I posted for another Pub hotel stay after my last stop at the Malt House.The manager was helpful and shoed me to my room, Very nice room, looks new and was very comfy. Bed was good and the desk was large and internet fast, I had a lot of work to catch up on after being in Italy with no WIFI. Google maps clocks this place as 11-18min walk to fulham broadway, it also takes you the long way around i think. found a few back street options off the North road.They didn't offer breakfast, they did offer a 10% discount at a place 5min away. i walked passed it one day and it didn't look very inviting. Went to shot in Fulham instead.Check out was a little annoying. My flight wasn't till 930 pm i wanted to leave bags at the hotel somewhere and grab them later in the day.Unfortunately check out is at 1030am and no-one is actually on site till 12pm. i was told if packed a bag of things i needed for the next day i could i leave my bag in the bar over night and and collect it next day when i was ready. This wasn't very convenient.i ended up taking my bag to paddington station and leaving in there locker system for 12 pounds for the day, that would i could just jump on the heathow express and not worry about the tube traffic.That and breakfast probably the only 2 minor problems i had at the captain cook. other wise its a great place stay.Bus stops out the front too which head in every direction.",28-Jul-17,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html

"The Captain Cook is a lovely place to stay. Fulham is a nice neighborhood with nearby choices for food and drink, and there's a large tube station within a 10 min walk (Fulham Broadway) that has a large shopping center in it. The nearby businesses mostly operate during business hours do there are not a lot of people around at night, and it's a quiet neighborhood. The hotel room was very clean, but smaller than I was expecting because they don't provide pics of all the rooms, just the biggest ones. We had an ensuite room that was smaller than expected. It would be nice if they showed all the room layouts so you know what you are getting. Also, if you cannot do stairs, you won't be able to stay here. All the rooms are up at least 1 flight of narrow windy stairs. But they will take your bags up and down for you. That was nice. One last heads up, they fill the water tanks on the coffee and tea makers so they're ready to go for you. But they don't always clean them first and you have no way to know when it was last filled. I thought they just had hard water when I saw the coffee water was murky, but after dumping it out, found a good deal of slime at the bottom of the tank. We had to wash the tank out and ran a few rounds of just hot water through the machine before we could use it. Then the water was much clearer. Just something to keep an eye out for.

"This was a great place for a weekend of food and football. It was easy to get to and from and if the weather had been better the opportunity for riverside walks was really tempting . Local pub recommendations too. Staff were very helpful both at check in carrying bags upstairs but also at meal times accommodating us around tables already booked felt like home from home. Brunch not breakfast was spot on - no rush to get downstairs on Saturday and Sunday morning, instead a gentle tea and coffee in bed, lovely shower and then a casual glide down to a mixed breakfast lunch menu. Lots of locals having bubbly and brunch! The room appliances and provisions were excellent and our room had a proper desk and light set up for those who need to work whilst away, also a comfy armchair big tv too. Friday night had happy hour .it was an easy walk to Craven Cottage for Saturday football And they had big screen football then live music in the evening.

"We had an excellent stay at the Captain Cook! The GM, Paul, was so accommodating and friendly. The staff in the pub downstairs, from the bartenders to the kitchen were top notch. The food in the pub is delicious, especially their Sunday Roast, and it's a perfect place to enjoy a drink after a long day sightseeing. We spent nine wonderful nights in this lovely accommodation and had easy access to center London through multiple bus and tube stops. We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to many of our friends. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a stay in one of London's hidden gems.

"I liked the Captain Cook the moment I saw its pictures. The maps on the wall, the wooden furniture, the colour of the light... It was just dreamy. I didn't even care to read many reviews before I booked it. Fortunately, it lived up to our expectation. True, the stay was not 100% perfect. 1. Our room faced the road, so when vehicles ran by it could be noisy. 2. Occasionally there were feathers pointing out from the blanket which felt scratchy. 3. There was a layer of limescale in the kettle. Despite of these, I absolutely enjoyed my stay there. The room was spacious and beautiful just like its pictures suggest, and the bed was very very big and comfy. There were lots of hangers next to a big window. The wifi signal was strong and stable. It's easily reached by buses going out from tube stations. It's situated in a nice and safe neighbourhood. And very importantly, its staff have excellent customer service. Overall speaking, good value of money, especially when it's more on the less expensive side among all choices in London. Definitely going back if I ever have the chance to visit London again, and would recommend my friends to stay there.",1-Nov-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"We stayed here as a part of our European trip. The location was awesome. Bu staying here, you are a 10 minute bus ride away from the Hammersmith station linking you to the tube and other buses. The room was nice a clean. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The price for this hotel was very reasonable. We opted to pay the extra to have a private bathroom in our room. We been took the time to have dinner in the pub downstairs. The food and service were excellent. We would stay here again.",31-Oct-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Just spent three nights here. Everyone in our party was very impressed with the quality of the accommodation. Thought it was also a tremendous value. Granted, you are not in the centre of town, but all the sights and shopping are very much accessible, just a short tube ride away. The pub itself is also very nice with excellent food and service. Highly recommended!",11-Oct-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"What a fantastic gastro pub this is ......lovely gem hidden away in Dawes Road. Food excellent, atmosphere friendly and welcoming and a special mention to Florian who is amazing always over and above call of duty to make sure your visit is enjoyable. Quiz night is fun on Sundays and the brunch is fantastic value for money there are special deals on wowcher. Will definitely be back again. Well done all the staff at the Captain Cook.",13-Sep-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
A beautiful pub with great service. Maddy made incredible cocktails and Dave the chef cooked up a scrumptious feast. I totally recommend the mac n' cheese! Beautiful court yeard out the back to enjoy a few drinks. ,5-Sep-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Another lovely evening at the very hospitable Captain Cook. Great burgers. Kid's menu very popular with the younger members of the family. Mojitos always go down a storm, alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike. Visits to the Captain Cook are always delightful, but made especially so when Jimmy is on duty. For us (and clearly also for others) he makes the pub 'our local' - which is no small thing these days. Note to all: if you leave a tip it goes to the staff. Well done CC management.

"When i arrived to the hotel, there was no reception.One lady in the hotels bar told me that the reception is at the bar.I waited around 20 minutes until the barman finished to pour the drinks to the customers, then took me to the room.The room was OK, but no air conditioner.Next day i had a reservation in other hotel, so i left my luggage in the Captain Cook, so i could go travel in the city, then pick up the luggage.The bar is closing around 23:00 - 23:30. So after 23:30 i couldn't pick up the luggage that i left in the Captain Cook and had to go to the second hotel without the luggage (clothes).I came back to Captain Cook next morning to take the luggage.At 08:00 the bar (reception) was closed.So i waited outdoor for 3(!) hours until some supplier came and opened the door, so i could pick up the luggage.As i understand, the bar is open from 12:00 to 23:30. So if you come to the hotel between 23:30 and 12:00 you'll find a closed door.",10-Aug-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"This is one place you don't want to miss out on! Our 4 night stay was perfect, from check-in to check-out. The rooms are spacious, very comfortable bed, and great amenities. The staff are awesome...very friendly and welcoming. Food in the pub is fantastic. Its about a 5 min bus ride to the Fulham station...15 min to downtown. Loved this place!",29-Jul-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Had a great stay at the Captain Cook. The room (room 1), was spacious and very well kitted out. There was a coffe machine, heaps of tea and coffee available, an excellent hairdryer (I know, but it really makes a difference to me). The bed was huge and very comfy. A good location on a bus route for getting around easily. We enjoyed the pub as well. Had some nice cocktails on Friday night (on happy hour prices - making them even better! ). And I really enjoyed the Sunday roast, great roasties. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great stay.

This is in the Chelsea area of London. Takes about 20 minutes to get into London. Close to both bus and the Tube. The rooms were huge and very comfortable. The food downstairs in the pub was amazing. Free tea in the pub. Restaurants and a grocery store is close.,23-May-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
I booked this hotel for my sisters hen do and right from the start Mike the manager could not have been more accommodating and helpful.The rooms are all large and spotlessly clean - all decorated lovely and homely - felt relaxed from the moment we were here.We had all 8 rooms so this was perfect for the hen as we could all get ready in each other's rooms - definitely recommend for large groupsthat are after a classy weekend with in easy reach of the station.Very peaceful considering the location - beds really comfy - perfect nights sleep.Staff were amazing - made to feel welcome from the moment we got there and food excellent.I will definitely stay here again on trips to London - loved it.,20-May-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"We arrived at The Captain Cook well after midnight, but the wonderfully helpful hotel manager had given us exactly the instructions we needed to find our room and our bed. And were we pleased! For budget reasons, we had chosen a very small room with an external (but private) bathroom. The room was elegantly decorated (as befitting a ship's captain!) and the bed was enormous. Linens were crisp and white. Teas, coffee and a big glass bottle of water sat invitingly on a writing desk Captain Cook would have loved. And the bathroom, though down the hall, was spotless and very contemporary in design. (The little containers of shampoo and body wash were so charmingly designed I had to take some home.) For $175 Canadian a night, this tasteful, cosy room was excellent value in a city like London. My daughter and I were completely comfortable there, and I'd happily stay again if their prices don't shoot up. It is a bit out of the way, in an interesting but safe district called Fulham, but everything in London is connected by a brilliant transit system, so that wasn't an issue for us. Would highly recommend The Captain Cook to anyone.",5-Apr-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"This place is first class, we stayed in the rooms they have there and they were extremely comfortable! well equipped and spacious. Very helpful staff and excellent food in the pub too. We were a group with 10 children and they provided camp beds, cots and high chairs and somewhere to leave buggies etc. Couldn't recommend it highly enough such a great place to stay in London.",24-Mar-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Absolutely amazing place. We booked all the rooms for my family when in London for our youngest sons wedding. 11 adults and 10 children ranging from 2 weeks old to 10 years old!! Mike could not have been more welcoming and helpful, nothing fazed him.Dave the cook came in specially to cook us all an amazing pre wedding brunch on the Saturday, and all the staff were so helpful in spite of a lot of kiddies to cope with. We are going to make this our London pad whenever we are in London it really is so good, I am a retired airline pilot and have stayed in some of the best hotels all over the world, all expenses paid of course! And I really mean it when I say this is one of the best.",15-Mar-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"We've been here a couple of times for weekend lunches and both times have been struck by how great the staff are - nothing is too much trouble and they're really smiley, kind (to the children) and happy to talk through the menu.There's lots of space to sit down, without the tables being crammed in, there's a box of toys for the children, and an encouraging open kitchen. The loos are clean, too.But the best bit (apart from the attitude of the welcoming staff), is the food - seriously top quality, generous, and well put together. If you knew this pub in its previous incarnation and weren't sure it would be any good, go, because it's utterly fantastic and my new fave for Sunday lunch in Fulham.",13-Feb-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
Couldn't have been made to feel more welcome when we arrived by Mike and the rest of the staff at The Captain Cook. The pub and the rooms are all decorated to a high standard and we really enjoyed the stay. Mike also recommended things to do in areas of London that we hadn't been before and this was very much appreciated.I would highly recommend staying here whenever you're in London and you enjoy staying somewhere where people appreciate your business.,8-Feb-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"It's not often I stay somewhere and fail to find fault with anything, so this is a first. The Captain Cook was perfect.Our room was incredibly spacious, and the bed was huge. Free tea and coffee, reliable wifi, unique decor, immaculate bathroom... there wasn't anything to dislike. As it was my wife's birthday, they even managed to arrange a bouquet of flowers for our arrival.Mike the owner was basically on call 24/7, so that was reassuring.You won't go far wrong ordering food in the pub restaurant downstairs, either - very reasonably priced for London, and much better than we had in the city.You've also got a Tesco Express within a minute's walk, Parsons Green tube about 5-10 minutes further, and the delights of Fulham in the other direction. All in all, it was a top stay.",25-Jan-16,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Had a delicious meal in the pub and as it was a Saturday night there was live music too - great atmosphere and very cosy. Room was really clean and nicely furnished, with extra touches like a nice Lavazza coffee machine. Plenty of room and a really clean, newly done bathroom. Shower was amazing - rainforest style! We were also lucky enough to get a VIP welcome with bubbles and chocolate coins!",22-Nov-15,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"We had a fantastic time at The Captain Cook. The hotel manager, Mike, was a delightful host on arrival and in giving us a tour of our room, complete with insightful historical knowledge of Captain James Cook and his travels. The room itself was excellent and included a large comfortable bed, flat screen TV, wifi, modern en suite (a great shower!) and all impeccably clean. For dinner we ate at the pub restaurant downstairs. Try the scotch egg, one of the best I have had and I have tried many. The food was delicious, filling and accompanied by a glass of well-recommended red. Overall, an excellent and authentic British hotel and pub experience. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay and will definitely be returning!",18-Nov-15,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"Before we even rented a room, the service was extremely helpful. ""Karl"" and ""Mike"" took the time to guide us and when we arrived the atmosphere was amazing. Mike printed every route to the places we wanted to visit, and always was up for a little talk. Not only was the service perfect, the room was as beautiful and comfortable as it is pictured on the site of The Captain Cook. The overall experience this pub/hotel is able to give is absolutely unique, and we would recommend it to everybody.",10-Nov-15,The Captain Cook,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8671439-Reviews-The_Captain_Cook-London_England.html
"My sister and I had a great stay at The Captain Cook. The pub is very well located, in a quiet neighbourhood, right next to a bus stop so it's easy to reach the centre of London.

We had an over night stay at the Hide London in Hendon. We went for this particular hotel due to them having parking on-site at no extra cost.We were welcomed at reception and shown where breakfast (continental) would be and then shown too our room (nice touch).Lovely comfortable and up to date room with a safe and fridge and very clean bathroom.Nice place to stay for our visit for Wembley stadium not far at all in an Uber. And plenty of food available locally if you don't want to stay in.,23-Jun-19,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Lovely hotel with contemporary furnishing and not easy to believe it's about ten years old. Friendly staff and real continental breakfast.The management have shared a little luxury with some nice touches: complimentary soft drinks, a variety of teas, coffee and hot chocolate, chocolates, facial tissues, hair conditioner and other bathroom accessories. A decent size bath towel would have been icing on the cake! Rooms quiet from traffic noise but be mindful that sound proofing between rooms isn't great and noisy residents may easily be heard. Parking spaces are just outside on private ground and would be suitable for motorbikes. For public transport, the London Underground is a few minutes walk away at Hendon Central... about 25 minutes takes you to King's Cross Station and further into the heart of the City. Ideal for sightseeing. Would highly recommend staying here.",18-Jun-19,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
This is a fab hotel. It’s good value and the facilities are good.

"Every time the wife and I visit, we stay at the hide. It’s so nice and so much cheaper than staying close to the center. It’s literally a 2 minute walk from the Hendon tube station which is 30 minutes into Leicester Square on the northern line. The staff are all super friendly and the breakfast is a great fuel up for a day in London.

"Love this place. Would stay again in a heartbeat. It's ideal. The good:-Lovely, modern decor-Comfortable bed-It has parking! That's right, parking!-Great value for money-A few minutes walk from the tube-Amazing breakfast-Friendly staffThe bad-I really can't think of anything-It's on a busy road, so you can hear cars if your window is open. But that's got nothing to do with the hotel",28-May-19,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Easy to find with great road and rail transport links. When we first arrived the staff were very friendly and welcoming which continued throughout our stay. The room, although not particularly large was very well thought out and the was plenty of storage space. A nice touch was the chocolates in the room and the complimentary soft drinks. The adjoining shower room was perfectly ample and the addition of good quality toilet tissue, shower gel, shampoo etc was very nice.If I am being picky, the only thing that let's the hotel down is the poor quality of the final finish. The wallpaper in the bedroom was not perfectly lined up and there were gaps in the joins and the grouting in the shower room was awful. Not major issues but little things that I notice. Overall it was a very nice stay and I would definitly go back.",2-May-19,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Really cute, chic and affordable hotel. The staff is lovely and excellent, they're always ready to help and serve and make things as easy possible. It's a 5 star hotel in my eyes and so is the service. Executive room is nice and new, breakfast at the hotel is free (that's amazing for London!).

"After awful experience with Airbnb I was lucky to find a vacant room in this gem of a hotel, which I wanted to book originaly, but was fully booked at the time.This boutique hotel offers much more than you would expect and it is worth all the money.

"Enjoyed a restful night here with a clean modern room and pleasant staff. They offered an umbrella in the rain, help with luggage etc and were polite and friendly. In the morning the continental breakfast on offer was fresh and varied, all round no complaints. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the difficult location if driving - luckily I had a satnav as it’s not easy to find if coming on the back roads, and is right on the very busy north circular, with cars flying by. So it can be hard to get in and out of the small car park. But this did not affect noise levels and would not be a problem if coming by public transport as there is a convenient underground stop 2 minutes away, plus local pubs and restaurants on the doorstep ",6-Feb-19,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Stayed here when we travelled to Winter Wonderland in December. We arrived early but checked in and were able to leave our bags. It's a lovely place with very clean and comfortable rooms. Nice ideas on space saving and making the most of every available space as we were in the top of the building under the eves as it were. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a lovely shower. Plenty of elbow room and suited our needs exactly. If I was being very picky, it was a shame the TV was not a little larger or on a swivel bracket - its was off set to one side so not that comfortable to watch when laid up in bed. One or two items in short supply for tea & coffee tray (why is it hotels only ever put 4 milk jiggers out!) and only one breakfast tea, tea bag - not a complaint, don't get me wrong, but with everything else so right about this place, just these little things detract. The place is quiet on an evening as pretty much it's a very nice B&B. The staff were very courteous and polite which was nice and very apologetic (although they didn't need to be) when they struggled a little with our drinks when we got back. Nice to sit comfortably and quietly watching a bit of news before retiring. Breakfast is continental and very nice it was too. Would we come back? Definitely as very convenient for us travelling from Yorkshire and even easier walking 2 minutes to the tube with only 30 minutes putting you in the West End. Thank you !",28-Dec-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"I was allowed to check in a little bit early, which was appreciated. All staff encountered were friendly. Room was nice. The bathroom was well decorated. Strangely the sink was really low, whilst the toilet was very tall. This isnt a criticism, just an observation. Unusual. The location isnt great being on the main road, but handy for the tube and for the University (where I was attending an event). Even with London prices I felt this was too expensive especially given there wasnt a cooked breakfast. There wasn't anything particualty wrong with the accommodation, it just wasnt great or excellent.",10-Dec-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"I chose to give this a 5 star review as I couldn’t think of anything bad to say about it. Modern, efficent, clean and fashionable. Great freebies in room, simple but good quality breakfast. Parking at the rear is tight, tube station 2 mins walk away. On the down side, not a huge amount to do in the area, and the road outside is crazy busy.

"We stayed here for my graduation in London it was really easy and fast to get to London from the hotel took about 20 mins! The hotel was easy to miss at first we drove past it and had to do some loops to come back, when you hit the cross roads where the tube station is after the lights on the left is the hotel go slow or you will miss it! The hotel accommodated us leaving our bags early, there was plenty of parking, we came back later after my graduation and the room was amazing, modern with tea coffee, big shower, all the little things that make it feel like home, complimentary drinks in the fridge too! Bed was so comfy as well. The only thing is we stayed in Room 24 at the top and it was boiling, we tried to sort the air con out but it didn’t seem to work :( had it right down to 17 degrees and was so hot still. Breakfast was lovely the next day, lots to choose from and the staff are lovely friendly and helpful! I wish I had just asked about the air con so my fault really! I would recommend, and I will stay again without a doubt!!! ",10-Nov-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"I like this hotel a lot, it isn't to difficult to get to from the M4, it has parking (but you may have to drive through a very narrow alley way). Rooms are very clean but a tad small , usual tea and coffee facility and complimentary soft drinks in the fridge. Breakfast is continental and very good in my opinion. It's always been quiet when I have visited ,mainly couples.Tube station is 150m up the road and there's a small 24hour shop between tube station and hotel.",24-Oct-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"I highly recommend staying at The Hide London. Everything was so clean and modern. The bed was comfortable, and the shower/bathroom was so perfectly clean as if it’s never been used. There was a small fridge that they kept stocked with water and drinks daily, and the room also had instant coffee, hot chocolate, and assorted teas with an electric kettle. They also have a complimentary breakfast in the dining room with assorted meats and cheeses, danishes, fruits, yogurt, juice, etc. It’s not in a very busy part of London, but it’s a 2-minute walk to the London Underground tube which is very convenient. If you do end up renting a car, I would suggest letting them know ahead of time to reserve a parking space because they have limited parking. I did this and my spot was reserved for the whole week without issue. The staff was kind and accommodating. So glad we chose The Hide London!",7-Oct-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html

In fact the bathroom and shower was so clean that my tired daughter walked into the shower door!

"We recently stayed here while visiting the RAF museum at Hendon. I found the property through a Google search. The Hide is only a 2 minute walk from Hendon Central Tube Station. It has been extensively modernised both outside and in and stands out from the neighbouring buildings. On site parking is a bonus. When we checked in we were immediately struck by the modern decor and cleanliness of the property. Our room, although not spacious was more than adequate. There was plenty of hanging space, the showeroom was well designed, well stocked and not cramped. There was a kettle with tea, coffee & biscuits and even complimentary soft drinks in the fridge. The staff were welcoming & friendly and there was a plentiful selection of fresh fruits, juices, yogurts & cereals along with breads, meats & pastries for breakfast.We would definitely book The Hide should we be visiting the area again.",17-Aug-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"The first thing I noticed when we arrived was how beautifully clean, tidy and modern the hotel was. We were greeted by the lovely staff and were very pleased with our room.

Free coffee and tea was available all day. A lot of sockets in the room. Good location. The room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was spacious. WiFi was very poor. Breakfast was substandard. The fruit salad was stale and insufficient. We had to always ask for refill. The staff was very reluctant to refill anything. We only saw the cake 3 days out of 7. The croissants were never fresh. One of the cleaning woman who didn’t know much English didn’t work properly. She left my dustbin full. Didn’t remove empty toiletries bottles and replace the bath gown. ,9-Jul-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"We last stayed here over a year ago in a double room. This time we booked an executive double room which had more space and more comfort (also robes and Bluetooth speaker). We were welcomed by a surprise in our room which was greatly received! Air con worked very well in the room and it was not loud. Complimentary refreshments within the minibar in the room were a nice touch. Comfortable beds and pillows, powerful shower, luxurious toiletries and a divine continental breakfast makes this hotel a five star rating! We will be back!

"We were attending a conference in London and wanted a clean, comfortable and wallet friendly hotel. The Hide fitted the bill perfectly. It’s small, with lovely decor and fittings. The bed was very comfy. The staff were courteous and helpful, the breakfast great, the little touches like complimentary soft drinks and high quality toiletries making it very competitive to the big hotel brands but all in all a great boutique hotel with parking and 2 minute distance from the underground.

Nice hotel with easy access to anywhere in London.

"Pleasantly surprised with the standard of this hotelThis is essentially a couple of residential houses that have been converted into a hotel.Parking is very handy, lots of nearby shops + underground is 5 mins walkThe rooms are of very good quality, good size and with very good quality fittings and finish.The biscuits, teas, shampoos etc are all boutique and very high quality.I would definitely use this hotel again and can recommend highly.I don’t believe the hotel has a lift which could be a problem for some visitors.",22-Apr-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Booked here for a Saturday night in London. Changed booking a couple of times as the price kept reducing! Got a standard double room for £85.The hotel is on the main road about a 3 minute walk from the Hendon Central underground stop. Nice friendly check in and shown to our room on the first floor. Room 10.Not the biggest room, but enough for us. Great bathroom with large shower, good water pressure and lots of products. There was a safe, tea facilities and a mini bar with 3 bottles of water, milk and 3 cans of pop. The hairdryer did not work but I popped to reception and he gave me spare one. It was a nice quiet room at the back of the hotel with a large opening window which we kept open all night as it was so warm. We went down for breakfast at 10am (served 8am - 11am on a Sunday). There was a large variety of fruit, yoghurt, bread, rolls, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, juices and hot drinks. The dining room was nice but very hot! We had a good night's sleep and thought it was great value for money. Friendly staff.

"I wanted so much to like this hotel, I went out of my way to stay here in fact. They have done an excellent job with the hotel decor, but there were some things that prohibit me from recommending it.Pros:Decor is lovelyBreakfast was sufficient to get the basicsBathroom amenities were high quality Location is very close to Hendon tube station Cons:The bed was awful. Thin, hard mattress and pillows that were flat and lumpy. I did not sleep well at all. Sheets were low thread count and scratchy. Why they spent so much time to have such a beautiful hotel and failed at one of the most important things perplexes me. The desk is not staffed 24 hours so if you need something you are basically out of luck.My hairdryer was broken in my roomThe wifi was so slow I could not get on or do any work. I had to leave the hotel and find a place with internet.The shower head in my room was installed so it tilted toward the wall and was fixed so you can’t adjust it. To get water in my hair I had to press myself against the wall to catch the full stream- I’m 5’2” and 100 lbs so I pity anyone larger than me trying to use that shower.Bottom line, if you want to stay in the area and don’t care about a comfortable bed,wifi or a courteous staff then you will enjoy this hotel. It has good potential for sure and with a few adjustments and maintenance it would be a good place to stay.",24-Mar-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"Stayed several times. Cans of pop and water in the fridge are included. Little chocolates are a nice touch. Clean, well decorated. Rooms on the small side (currently in room 2). The continentals breakfast is better than you may expect, enough to fill you up and tasty. I quite like the lack of temptation of a full English!I stay here when attending the university and it is a very short walk there.There is a decent sized park behind the hotel which is good for a few laps on a morning run.Aircon/heating is pretty noisy but can be turned off.Reception and breakfast staff have always been a pleasure to speak to.",21-Mar-18,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html

"This is a medium hotel located quite close to the Hendon tube station. It is very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is ample although a bit ordinary, e.g. all the cereals are packet cereal. The croissants were not all that fresh but there was a good variety of breads and pastries. Although I don't have a full breakfast, it was available. Parking is available on site. The room and bed were comfortable. The room is not overly big but large enough for the two of us and our bags. The hotel is modern but in a conservative style. The rooms facing the back are subjected to a constant hum of the air-conditioning units. The bathroom is fine with a large shower but the basin could do with an extra shelf on the wall or on the mirror for one's accessories. The shower really needs some non-slip strips when you get in. I asked for and was supplied with a rubber mat after slipping a couple of times.",1-Nov-17,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html

"I recently visited The Hide London and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is a small boutique hotel run by very helpful and friendly staff. It is located close to supermarkets, restaurants, a mall and most importantly it is a stone's throw away from the underground station. Heading into Central London was so easy from this hotel. If you are planning to see the sites and explore Central London purchase an Oyster card for zones 1-3. The station for the hotel is on the border of zone 3/4. There is no need to purchase zone 4 if you are only planning to explore the sites and mostly Central London. That will save you a little money on the card. Overall I enjoyed my stay. My only con would be the water in the shower doesn't get too hot, but that is a personal preference. Absolutely nothing against the hotel or my stay.

"One of the best hotel I ever stay... Free Wifi, Very clean, quiet, excellent and complete breakfast, Lovely staff. We have tea and delicious cookies everyday. They offer flip flops, L'Occitane products (shampoo, conditioner, cream, shaving products, nail file, toothpaste and toothbrush), The Bedding and towels are replaced continuously. They offer, water, and soft drinks daily at the mini bar; We can drink orange/apple/tea, everyday at the restaurant, without additional costs. We received a few chocolates at the first day.. This hotel is very close to Hendon Station. (5 MIN WALKING). Although there is not much stores nearby, we can count with an Indian restaurant and an Italian restaurant next to subway station of excellent quality. and there are a few local markets that may be useful ...

"I stay at The Hide regularly and feel I must respond to the review left by emzfab82. I appreciate reviews are subjective but I feel the comments made are unfair and in my opinion should be ignored for the following reasons:1, The staff are all lovely and will bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable2, the hotel cannot be blamed for a cancelled concert. The Hide is a business and the T's & C's are pretty clear. Why would you expect a refund! I'm pretty sure The Hide didn't ask Adele to cancel her performance!3, this hotel is clean, tidy, well managed, customer focussed and reasonably priced4, personally, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when I visit London5, for a more balanced view, have a look at all the other reviewsI cannot recommend The Hide highly enough!",6-Jul-17,The Hide London,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1886452-Reviews-The_Hide_London-London_England.html
"We checked into the Hide for one night while in London for a concert. It's location at the end of the M1 and right next to Hendon Central Underground station was the main reason for choosing it but the good TA reviews persuaded us too. On arrival the staff on the desk could not have been more friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable and well equipped, even with a free minibar, and faced the rear of the property so it was quiet. Everything feels quite new and modern. Parking was not a problem as there seems to be plenty of space. Next morning we enjoyed a continental breakfast which I have to say is one of the best of its kind I have had anywhere in the world, and I stay in hotels for over 100 nights a year. Well done to the people who run this lovely little hotel, it really is a gem.

The Staff are the most wonderful people and always very helpful. It is very central and Transport from here is excellent. The Tube is a 2 minute walk or less and the service from both the buses and the trains are excellent. We hope to return for our third time in 18 Months.

The menu is great - freshly cooked grills, burgers, pizza and salads, and their bar is well stocked. I pop in at least every few weeks on my own or with a friend, and they regularly give free starters/ or dessert if we dine. I have also stayed once at the hotel, which can't be faulted for the very reasonable price. Good sized, clean rooms and I am sure if any problems occurred they would be dealt with fantastically.

"I had to decamp from my flat to the nearest hotel one night after being locked out in circumstances that are hilarious to look back on now, but the outcome was that I arrived at the Lion and Key in something of a state and had little expectation of the facilities. I was, therefore, very surprised to find one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed in, and certainly the best for its price category. The hotel opened very recently so everything is new and in the modern minimalist style. I happen to be super into stone effect and grey wood panelling, so this was great. Everything was clean. The hotel contains a restaurant that provided complimentary room service, which is ridiculous and amazing. There is an internal intranet on the TV. The bed is memory foam and awesome and the bathroom was spotless and stocked with the little gels. The staff were discreet and did not bother me when I needed them, if you know what I mean. I spent my night drinking my complimentary tea, eating my dinner from my complimentary room serviced tray, and watching BBC Parliament. I had such a great night. Honestly, I only live just down the road but have seriously considered just coming and staying again. Very highly recommended.",16-May-19,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html

The room and bathroom were warm, elegant and big enough for those who stay outside all day long. The room was cleaned and the bed sheets were changed each morning, making the atmosphere comfy and pleasant. The zone is ok, 10 minutes from the metro station on foot.

I wasn’t happy with the heating it was pretty cold in my room even though I had reported this to reception nothing was done to solve it.",13-Dec-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"I was visiting London on business and needed somewhere comfortable but decent value. I found the Lion and Key online and I wasn't dissapointed. The room was well equipped, a decent size and nice and clean and comfortable. Surprisingly for a hotel on a main road it wasn't noisy and sleep quality was good.The food was of a good quality and reasonably priced. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. One key issue is that of parking. I paid £30 to park in the hotel car park whilst I stayed. The car par is very small and getting in and out can be a bit of a faff, however be advised local parking is an issue so if you can arrange parking do so.",26-Nov-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"A really nice modern (recently refurbished) hotel. It has been converted from a pub and retains a nice bar/restaurant downstairs. The rooms are very clean, modern and everything works. They are large, by London standards. Bathrooms are equally clean and modern. The restaurant is great as well. Clean and spacious. The food is good, good value and plentiful, you won’t go hungry here. The staff were polite and particularly the restaurant staff were friendly. My only very slight issue is that the reception staff were a little brusque. A more chatty warm welcome would have been nice. The other thing to watch is that they need a form of ID when checking in. Quite why this is needed is not clear to me as no other hotel insists on it. The final drawback is that the hotel is a bit off the beaten track. It’s a good 10-15 min walk from Leyton Tube station. And the area of Leyton itself is a bit rough. But all in all it’s. nice modern good value and clean hotel that I will use again.",7-Nov-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
We picked this hotel as it was on wowcher and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. Staff were all very friendly and welcoming and the rooms were large clean and have everything you need including a small kitchen (which we did not know we were getting). The bar downstairs was good and not bad price for drinks. Didn't have any food but it looked delicious. Not far from the tube station and very close to a tesco and a sainsburys express. Would definitely recommend.,22-Oct-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"We stayed here for 1 night whilst visiting friends in the Leyton area. The hotel proved to be a perfect spot for the visit, conveniently located for visiting the East of End of London, particularly Leyton, Hackney Wick, Stratford etc.The booking process was straight forward as was the check in when we arrived quite late on Friday evening. The hotel itself was friendly and welcoming. The reception was clean and well presented. The room was modern with a great bathroom and shower, plenty of plug sockets (usually an issue) and the usual faculties in the room. Everything worked perfectly and there were no issues at all. We didn’t opt for breakfast but the ones we saw looked very good. Overall a top spot for us and we’ll be returning when visiting the area again in the near future.

Three of us stayed just for one night. What a welcome change from the usual branded hotels. This independent hotel was booked as working less than a mile away but didn’t expect too much in this part if town.Reception were helpful and efficient. Limited parking in a secure courtyard was a little expensive at £15 but street parking locally is probably difficult.Small but tidy room finished to a very high standard with reasonable free internet and freeview.After a couple drinks in the bar we ventured out to eat. Bad move. The whole street apart from this hotel is alcohol free restaurants!So back to the hotel for food. We were all glad that we ended up eating in the hotel restaurant as the food was excellent.A great find in an area thats a little run down.,8-Oct-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"An immaculate modern hotel behind an old pub facade. Has a mediterranean feel with polished stone flors and walls, well lit with natural light with a central atrium.

"Well I was pleasantly surprised by this quite new renovated Pub, I rarely stay at pub hotels as I fear the noise and discontentment off rowdy revellers, but this was so not the case with The (Lion & Key Hotel), On entering the reception area although small and compact it was well designed wit the small space in which they had to work with, staff were on hand, and although the bar restaurant were keeping them quite busy thee was enough staff able and competant to book myself in. Arival to te room I was happy enough with the room at such short notice small but neat clean and tidy, though my room faced the High Street the double glazing worked well the air conditoning worked well as it was quite hot, the bar I found at £6 was decently priced, so I actually used it for a changed, I had requested two extra pillows which were already provided in the room, so I had no need to ask again which happens for me regularly, anyway my short stay went well, I would definately recommend a short stay there but alas if I was to be honest, I aquired the room on a cut price deal, on review I have seen it's true price and feel this is far over the top in prices, and would only recommend staying there when the deal is right !!",29-Sep-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"The blurb for this place promises West end Luxury in the East End..well I can't say it was luxurious but it was very clean and tidy, the room was sparsely furnished but everything was functional and spotless. The bed was comfortable enough but not luxurious and the same could be said for the shower room which was certainly no bigger than was necessary. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the quality of that but it was at least £10 per head which would make b and b for 2 pushing £160 which is not great value. I would like to give this 3.5 stars but I can't so 3 will have to do.",17-Sep-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"Chose this place due to the reviews and I must say it lived up to expectations. Room was great, the staff too. The restaurant was a revelation. Try the Turk breakfast, very impressive and great value too. Forget the full English, no comparison. Evening menu gives a wide range of options, fit for all tastes. Good location for Leyton and the tube. Parking is limited though and at £15 per night a little on the high side but worth it in my opinion as its secure. You need to book it in advance. Highly recommended.",27-Aug-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"I have lived in this area for a number of years. The Lion & Key is a welcome addition to the area because there is little or anything decent within the area. The hotel is a very small modern hotel. I got in very late in the evening time. I got dinner in the restaurant area which was ok but there are better alternatives in Leyton if you are around earlier in the evening. The 2 nights I stayed while going to see family relations were cheap compared to normal hotel accomodation in London. The room was lovely. Both bedroom and bathroom were clean and well equipped. One big word of advise though. If you are a light sleeper who finds it difficult to sleep with noisy traffic outside, bring earplugs. This is a area where there is a lot of traffic and the windows and curtain in my room were in my honest opinion poor and inadequate for the area in question and need replacing. This is a downside to the hotel.",26-Aug-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"I recently stayed at this hotel with my 11 year old daughter as a birthday treat. We was greeted by a very friendly receptionist, a helpful member of staff when we had problems getting into our room and then a excellent team working in the restaurant area. We both enjoyed both dinner and breakfast. The room was clean and beautifully designed just like the rest of the hotel. As our room was in the front of the buildibg i thought that the traffic would interfer with my sleep but i was wrong. The bed was comfortable and I had an amazing sleep. We had a really great time staying at this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",20-Aug-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"This hotel is wonderful from the reception to the rooms. Probably due to the area you are required to provide ID and have a £50 deposit against damage. Once you have gone past the warm welcome from reception that has a good open clean decor, you will take the lift to your room.A great sign for a good hotel is cleanliness and sharp chic design. This the hotel has in abundance. Moving to the room. It is spacious modern with an inviting bed and the essentials required for your stay. The TV provides hotel information along with your standard Freeview channels.The bathroom is immaculate with lovely marble and an excellent shower. The only negative point is having to leave. It is reasonably priced and can be reserved at lower prices if caught in time. Another plus point is the cafe, bar and grill alongside with a friendly front of the house manager. Service is fast and the food well presented. This is the gem of East London without a doubt and certainly the number one choice for the price. If you are in the area there is no better choice. Excellent!",13-Aug-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html

Wee bit of a distance from underground but easily remedied by 4 stops on No.69 or 97 bus (only 4 tube stops to Liverpool St).Fabulous entrance into reception / bar / restaurant. Lovely, welcoming reception staff and swift check in. Room was beautiful, exactly as per the pictures on website with a lovely modern marbled bathroom. I had a room at the back that was very quiet. Didnt try the breakfast as had to leave early each day, but the menu and dinner in evenings was really good.

"The Lion and Key has a major strength and that is the quality of its staff. Friendly from check in to check out and at all levels of staff. The place is very clean and seems well maintained. However there is nowhere in the bathroom to put make up and other toiletries even whilst in use. This includes nowhere in the shower to put soap, shampoo etc whilst showering, so a wash bag roll which you can hang on the back of the door would be very handy! I felt the rooms were designed for a man by a man since to make matters worse there is no full length mirror! But given the excellent price we paid and the super obliging staff these were only minor niggles. This was an excellent base for us to visited relatives in Leyton, it is not in a pretty location and the area may feel rather rough after dark if you are not used to urban areas although we walked everywhere or used cabs and at no time felt worried. We will definitely return...with our hanging wash bag! ",31-Jan-18,The Lion & Key Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8833274-Reviews-The_Lion_Key_Hotel-London_England.html
"I want to really give my thanks (and a great review) to all of the people at the Lion and Key for the kindness and enjoyable stay afforded me in my recent visit. I was in London for 8 nights (my first time in the winter) and was lucky enough to find this little jewel. The staff was always friendly and helpful. True, it is not in a touristy area, but I walked around the area and the short distance to the underground station, day and night, without any hint of problem. There are a variety of bars and restaurants in the vicinity. My room was quiet, cleaned daily, and larger than many I've had in Europe. The bar and restaurant we're quite good also, both affordable and good. I left sad to leave, and I don't always have that feeling.

Needed somewhere local to stay as a result of helping family decorate their property. Check in was easy and staff were really friendly. Our room was excellent. Great furnishings and the shower was really good. We had eaten so we didn't try the restaurant. We had a really good nights rest and the following morning we had a late breakfast.

"This is a new hotel just 4 stops along on the Central Line from Liverpool Street so great for Stansted Airport or GatwickLeyton area is very up & coming with lovely parks, open spaces, quiet streets and plenty of cafes and small shops - Tesco Metro right close by and a Sainsbury's Local too. The rooms are spotless and all new beds, bathrooms and fitting. A great place for a budget price. The Lion & Key is an old Victorian building steeped in history which the current owners are respectful to observe. The name may be hard to remember but they didn't want to compromise the history - think Lion King holding the keys - and look out for the lions holding the keys in their mouths protection and the gatekeeper of heaven all around the hotel. There is a small car park, you probably have to book it but we use the tube (3 mins walk to Leyton tube) or the very frequent buses into town. The restaurant is modern & comfortable with a great menu for breakfast, lunch or supper - we love the speciality 'Pide' stuffed breads, they are huge. We go with friends, grandchildren and all enjoy eating there. The staff are so friendly and caring, they love children and ours feel very at home.

"Stayed for a few nights recently - is a good location for London I will give them that. The hotel and rooms are outdated. The bar smelled horrible and the WiFi rarely worked properly. It was so hot, weather I know they cannot control but with one fan and the window opened, it was still very unpleasant. I’m not sure how it has so many great reviews but they are truly in need of a makeover.",29-Jun-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

"My wife and I had romantic dinner and a night away at the Mad Hatter this May. We started with drinks outside watching busy Londoners go by, having way less fun than us. Dinner was delicious and the staff was friendly. Our room was cozy, but spacious, and there were some nice freebies included. (Next part edited out for children). For breakfast we both had eggs Benedict which we enjoyed thoroughly. What a great place right in town.",4-Jun-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Very clean and exceptionally comfortable bed, everything you could want was provided, including a cafetière. The only downside was the breakfast which was very poor, so I would recommend going out for breakfast as we paid £12 per person for a very inedible meal.",4-Jun-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
As a family we decided to try dinner at this hotel/bar. We ordered our meals at 8.05pm and after some 45 minutes of waiting our meals actually arrived but all 3 meals were cold and had to be sent back. All meals had to be freshly made but even when they arrived we were not impressed with the quality of the food. As a result a personal letter is going to be forwarded to the CEO (Simon Enemy) to outline the errors of the evening and the staff actions.,30-May-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"This was our third visit to the Mad Hatter in London. Previously we had been delighted by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which coupled with the location, relaxed bar and parking within walking distance meant that we were happy repeat customers. This time it was not so relaxing and the reason for this lies primarily with the evening bar staff.As has been pointed out by other reviewers the rooms are starting to look tired and will hopefully be up for a refurb very soon. We like the Fullers model and are also frequent visitors to another Fullers hotel/pub but this one seems to be facing some challenges. The room we stayed in this time clearly had some cleaning issues as the ceiling fan was coated with dust, a fairly thick layer, and there was further dust which had collected on one of the walls however any shortcomings in the standard of the rooms had always been outweighed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and this is still in evidence as we were dealt with efficiently and professionally at check-in despite arriving early. We like to arrive early so that we can have a pub lunch in the bar and as usual we did this and staff were attentive and proficient. No problems there. Later, as we left the hotel for the evening, we did what we had done previously and handed our order for breakfast in the room to the receptionist. The hotel advertises breakfast in your room at no extra charge but does not make it easy to do so with no actual breakfast menu in the room and no form to fill in. Nevertheless I had written it clearly on a piece of paper. The receptionist, who was notably dressed down in jeans and tee-shirt, seemed confused but promised to get it to the kitchen. We were going out to a show and another reason we like this hotel is that after the show we like to come back to the pub and have a relaxing drink and to wind down before going to bed. This time the bar was far from relaxing. Bar staff were loud, unprofessional and scruffily dressed. They clearly didn't want to be there, wanted to get home and regarded customers as an inconvenience. We know because we heard them telling each other so. They also stood outside one of the fire exits smoking whilst another used the disabled toilet for a very long time keeping my disabled friend waiting and not even offering a 'sorry' on exit. We felt that all of this was unprofessional and definitely not welcoming or relaxing and for this reason we will be looking at other hotels in the area and comparing with the Mad Hatter before our next visit to London. That's the simple effect that unprofessional staff can have on your business!We did get that breakfast in our room but only after a call to our room querying whether we did actually want it in the room which suggested that communication between reception and kitchen may not have taken place as it should have. Most hotels have a card which can be filled in and put outside your door, why not this one? Also it would be good practice to use plate cloches to keep the food warm, something I have flagged up before, but which are not in use at the Mad Hatter.",27-May-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Staying in Central London for only 159GBP a night is great. And this hotel is wonderfully located, near two tube stops, with easy access to just about all the tourist sights, in a decent area. The staff is friendly, the breakfast is good (and can be had for 10GBP with advanced notice as a guest), and the rooms are spacious for London at this price. However, there are a few things that need improving. The climate control is minimal, which would not be a problem in the winter, but the room was hot and stuffy when the outside temps were in the upper 60s F in May. The cleaning products used were very strong smelling. And with the windows open (to deal with the heat) it was very noisy at night.There was a small issue with the bill - nothing huge, just some minor account tracking issues, which was handled appropriately by the staff. Overall, I'm happy with the choice for 7 nights in May. But a few small changes would make a world of difference.",26-May-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"I am reviewing the bar and not the hotel.I have several passions in life and high on the list are London Pride & Pies. Indeed as a regular tourist to London these are two things which I actively seek out and so came across this place like an oasis in the desert. Its a nice looking bar as you would expect from Fullers. There it sadly stops. The bar could do with a good clean, the food was average at best but the staff were unfortunately lazy and simply disinterested in serving. My recommendation is to go round the corner to Doggets.",14-May-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

"You couldn't make it up really, visit a |Fullers Ale and Pie house only to be told they haven't got any pies. Seriously guys !!???!! OK they offered a few Sunday Roasts, but why can't they manage to maintain the pie menu too??The roast was a little expensive, and fell a little short on quality. Sure I've had much worse, but a small portion of pre-sliced beef does not impress.",24-Apr-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

"This hotel is probably one of the best i have been to. 15 min walk to Big Ben. Blackfriars station 5 mins away. The hotel is clean, beds comfortable. Rooms are just the right size. Coffee machine, free tea and coffee even hot chocolate. First night everything is free in mini bar. The pub wasn't at all noisy and i was above it second floor. The food was expensive and not brilliant but you only have a 5 minute walk to any other watering hole.Staff were so friendly and helpful. Check out is 1100 but they will look after your cases in reception no charge. Again i cannot stress how perfectly placed this hotel was for us. We did a lot of walking because we wanted to but tube service is literally 5 mins away. would thoroughly recommend and hope to return soon.

"Friendly staff, reasonably good location. The pictures of the hotel do not accurately reflect it's tattered reality. This hotel is in serious decline. Our bathroom was full of broken tiles. The nylon floor was ripped and moldy in places. The shower screen was broken so water leaked everywhere. One window didn't shut properly. 3 out of 4 locking mechanisms for the 2 windows were broken. There were screws in the door to hold a now missing plaque, I assume a fire safety plan. I guess we didn't need one. In general a seriously dusty room. I would never stay here again nor recommend this hotel to others.

"I was here as part of a large student group which spent about a week at the MH. The location is within easy walking distance to most touristy attractions, and several tube stations which open up the rest of London. Staff was always polite and enjoyed having a chat with customers. The rooms were nice with extremely comfortable beds and clean facilities. Judging by other hotels in the area, the MH has large rooms which made sharing the space with a roommate much easier. This is a great place to stay.",11-Mar-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

"We arrived ~2 hours before check-in time, and were able to get into our room early, which was appreciated since we were coming straight from the airport (note: we didn't call / intend to get in early. We planned to just drop our bags, so getting into our room was a huge plus). The included mini-bar and the coffee / tea was fab, we loved the Dyson heater to warm ourselves up after exploring the rest of the afternoon, and the room itself was big enough for two females getting ready with two big bags - plenty of space to throw things around and illuminated mirror area to do hair and makeup. We only stayed for a night before continuing to other cities in the UK, but I would return again without hesitation. Additionally, we stored our bags with the front desk for the rest of the day after checking out because our train wasn't until the evening. We were slightly concerned because there were a lot of bags just sitting around - granted all labeled, but not stored in a room or kept away from the public. We returned and all our stuff was there, no issues, but our one suggestion would have been to have a more organized / tucked away luggage storage system.",12-Feb-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"My partner and I stayed for our anniversary in January 2019. Upon arrival, it was so close to Blackfriars bridge and the tube station with a little Waitrose opposite which was handy. When walking in there was a foul smell in between the front door and the 2 doors for the pub or hotel everytime we walked through to leave or come back. The lady on the checkout didn’t give us any information about when check out was and didn’t seem to be interested in the fact we were even there, as 2 people that have worked in hospitality for many years it was the beginning of undertrained staff. When walking to the room everything felt rather dated and didn’t look as retro-modern as the pictures had led us to believe, sacks of dirty linen were stacked in the hallways, reassuring everything was clean but not the nicest to walk through. The room itself was very clean with a lovely stocked mini fridge that was free for the duration of our stay, probably the highlight of our stay, a really nice addition. The view from the room wasn’t the nicest, basically a dirt pit building site but not the hotels fault obviously. We saw a lovely 3 course veganuary menu in the room we were excited to try in their pub downstairs, with myself having a disability we felt it’d be easier to stay on site. We went downstairs to the pub and saw the cocktails were on from 5pm-7pm Monday to Thursday however when ordering one the bartender said they didn’t serve them after 5pm during the week, the exact opposite of what was advertised in the menu, blackboard, sign outside... basically felt that he didn’t want to make one. We were then told we could sit at a table that felt we were intruding on a private function and saw the veganuary specials board only had 1 meal on out of the 6 starters and mains that were on the website and menus on the tables and in our room. We wanted to be able to have more of a choice and more than one course for our anniversary so decided we should probably start searching else where. We came back to the room after dinner and went to sleep. The next morning I was woken up to knocking on the door several times by the time I was able to get out of bed no one was there. We rang the front desk to double check the check out time as it wasn’t on the welcome letter either. After checking out, we went to our prepaid breakfast in the pub at 10.20am, it stated everywhere that breakfast ended at 11am however when we arrived the continental breakfast had been put away, tea, coffee, juices, everything put away. One of the waitresses rolled her eyes when she saw us walk in which then made me feel really bad but as we’d already paid when booking, we weren’t going to miss the food. We ordered 2 vegetarian breakfasts, my partner asked for a tea, we weren’t offered any drinks or anything else at all so I didn’t ask for a drink as I felt guilty being there and everything had been packed away, luckily I had some water in my bag. The breakfast came, and we shouldn’t have been surprised it wasn’t great, the hash browns were really oily and the veggie sausage had a really odd, strong, not appealing taste to it, I left it and my boyfriend with a stomach of steal felt ill for the rest of the day. Honestly, I was really looking forward to staying at the mad hatter, it looks like a really nice homely pub and B&B but, the staff let it down more than anything. Uninterested is what I’d describe the service as, not wanting to adhere to any promotions advertised ie. cocktails, breakfast end time, standard check in info. I’ve never felt like I needed to write a review before but honestly, if this was my place of work I’d want to know how bad the customer service was. I hope this helps enable staff to not ruin anyone else’s stay or special occasion. I’ve rated 3/5 down to cleanliness and general special touches alone.",8-Feb-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Spent 3 nights here in january with my husband. It's in a great location near 2 tube stations. There was a great little Waitrose across the road too. It's like a small family run hotel and it's not the most modern hotel but I loved it. The staff were friendly the room was cleaned each day and the bed was super cosy...I think this is very important especially after walking around sight seeing all day. Added bonus is the mini bar is always full and free! There was also free tea/coffee and biscuits in the room. The bathroom was lovely and fully stocked with hand soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and those great little emergency sets ie sewing kit. I would have no hesitation staying here again and bringing the kids. I seen reviews about the noise outside, the hotel is situated beside traffic lights but the noise was not excessive at all.",7-Feb-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Decided to call in on the off chance as simply liked the name. It’s part of a hotel, but we just tried the bar. Nice atmosphere, with several booths for about 4 people making it cosy and personal. Lots of guest beers to try, I recommend a pint of Festival as it’s a full bodied Suffolk Ale. The pub interior is immaculate. All very clean, clearly well tended woodworks surrounds to beautiful mirrors. Friendly staff so when I’m back in town I’ll call in. Didn’t eat on this occasion but saw someone else with fish and chips and it looked superb.",3-Feb-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"We are visting from wales and staying at the hotel. Rooms are beautiful and reasonably priced . Mini fridge in room with free drinks was a nice touch. Pub downstairs is very comfy. Was served lunch by two ladies they was very welcoming and delightful. My husband and I both had Sunday roasts. Yorkshire puddings tasted very eggy and stale, which was a shame because the rest of the food was good.

"Enjoyed the good fortune to bunk here for a couple days to attendance a conference. The property location is excellent, a comfortable 7-10 minute walk from Southwark tube station. The rooms are on the smaller side, consistent with most properties of its age. The amenities include a coffee press, hot chocolate, ale, cider, and a full menu of other beverages which come with the price of the room. The rooms are clean, the reception helpful, and the breakfast is fantastic, buffet and ala carte. On the down side, its a little pricey, and the wireless is extremely slow during peak business hours. Breakfast begins at 7:00, which for those of us with early flights, meant we did not benefit from it.",2-Feb-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a night to celebrate our 4 year anniversary (we went for lunch at Bob Bob Ricard & to the theatre to see Lés Misérables so thought we’d go the whole hog and stay the night too!). It was absolutely BRILLIANT. After scrolling through endless overpriced hotel rooms on booking.com with photos of terrible decor and rooms without windows (...really?!!), I was a little apprehensive about our stay in the city. My boyfriend emailed them in advance to say it was our anniversary after seeing them asking guests to let them know if they are celebrating a special occasion and they went out of their way to decorate our room. There were balloons, special pillows, faux rose petals and even a free bottle of prosecco on ice waiting for us which was absolutely incredible and very generous!! The minibar is also complimentary for the first night for all guests which is stocked full of various drinks (including beer!) plus a great selection of coffee (with a special cafetière alongside the kettle) and even hot chocolate. I find this amazing and again, very generous of the hotel to provide all of these things free of charge to their guests. We arrived an hour and a half early before the check in time and asked if there was any chance we could check in early and they were more than happy to help, the manager calling the housekeepers to ask and in the meantime asking if we’d like to store our luggage with them at the reception. We had a drink at the bar, being served by a young friendly barman (the bar is stunning with the most fun, cosy booths, Alice in Wonderland themed touches and house plants), before going to our room early after being given the go ahead from the housekeepers. The room was a lovely size with a large, bright window and a bath which I took full advantage of the next morning! We explored the city for the day and returned after 11pm, buzzing to be let in by the night porter as instructed earlier that day who was very friendly and helped us with our query regarding where to find late night food in the area. The hotel is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the tube station. We ended up getting a taxi home from Covent Garden and it didn’t cost much at all as it’s so close to the action! We had a good night sleep at the hotel although the road outside was quite noisy - though this is to be expected in the capital and easily handled with some comfortable ear plugs. My only suggestion would be to perhaps provide bubble bath for the rooms with bath tubs even for a fee (I attempted to use the shower gel provided to create bubbles which didn’t last very long so this would have been a great option for me). This was an amazing hotel and if we return to London for a night in the future we will definitely stay here again unless we decide splash out on a swanky five star option just for the experience. This has become our go-to hotel for sure!",31-Jan-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

The old building with its dual door entrance (one to the hotel, the other to the pub) is charming! The center bar, wood booths and wooden chairs add to the delight!

"Didn't want to eat at our hotel so figured we'd walk down the street and see what else was open. Saw that they had breakfast on the menu at this pub so figured we'd go in and check it out. Took forever for a menu. Then we ordered coffees, juice, English breakfast, and pancakes. Food took literally 40 min to come out. Seriously, how long does it take to make scrambled eggs, heat up beans, and fry some bacon? The pancakes weren't homemade but rather were just reheated from the freezer section...so why did it take so long?? The pub wasn't even busy --there were three other tables. I wanted a latte but the waiter said that he'd bring us coffee. ?! Coffee wasn't anything to write home about. We asked where our food was at one point, and the waitress told us that we had to wait because there were other tables in front of us. ???! I'm a loss for words. We left after paying quickly and were glad we didn't stay at the hotel and had to put up with this kind of service and food every morning.",13-Jan-19,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html

Paid upfront extra for breakfast which was good, lots of choices. I had a room on the first floor; being above a pub there was some noise one night, but it was over by 11pm (closing time). Yes, there was some construction noise as building is going on behind the hotel but again, they knocked off by 4pm each day, so again no bother to me.

My room was big, very well equipped and even had a FREE mini bar (yes, non alcoholic, but still free). Comfortable big rooms and a great location (provided you want to be near Waterloo or Southwark).

"Visited London Friday/Saturday 23rd/24th November, combining a business conference with a rare night out and a West End show.Decided to have dinner at the hotel Friday evening in the bar.Unfortunately we experienced a few problems while ordering our meal and, as a result, we met the Manager (Rachel). She was absolutely superb from the moment she came to our table.First thing she did was to unreservedly apologise without offering the usual excuses. Then she asked what she could do to resolve the situation, listened to all that we had to say and came up with a resolution instantly.I must compliment Rachel and her team for fantastic food, tasty beer and wine on what was obviously an extremely busy evening in the bar.Our room was light, airy and spacious and the bed was very comfortable.We enjoyed a delicious breakfast before checking out the following morning.We will definitely recommend The Mad Hatter to friends and, will definitely be staying there again.",30-Nov-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Stayed here for one night on a work trip. I had visited the bar previously a few years for a beer and food, so booked as knew location. It's a small hotel just a few minutes from Southwark Tube and walking distance to Waterloo. This makes it very accessible from Gatwick or London City Airport. Double room was good, comfortable bed with a small bathroom. The phone is a mock old style model, quiely! In a rather nice touch, everything in the mini-bar is free - a London Pride (it's a Fuller's Hotel), a cider, selection of soft drinks and water. Will definitely stay here again, superb location, friendly staff and a nice bar on the premises.

"Stayed there for a week; the room was clean. The water was hot. The minimal interaction with the staff was perfectly adequate. Location is great; short walk to the Underground. Noise-It's a big city, so it's going to be noisy. That being said there is a high probability the when the construction starts on the surrounding lot(s) that noise will be an issue. I would verify with the front desk before making reservations. As with all older buildings in London, there is no air conditioning, and at this time of year it wasn't a problem, but I would hesitate to stay here in the summer. Note: When you walk out the front door pause for a moment and look at about your 1 o'clock....you'll have a great view of St. Pauls from the front door of the property. The pub, like pretty much every pub/restaurant we ate at, did struggle with customer service. Not sure why that is, but it's not unique to the pub at the property. Staff was super friendly....just struggling. Will stay again.",13-Nov-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"A little shabby in some ways and a very limited menu but free mini bar ... soft drinks, water, tea etc. and no room service charge was perfect. We were working at Kings, just along the road and made the most of the hotel’s proximity to the South Bank to walk and see London. Good service and we hope to be back",10-Nov-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"My husband and I stayed on a cold Monday in October but had a warm welcome and were told we were guests of the week! Cue much excitement on our part! This meant we had a bottle of prosecco waiting on ice in the room, and complementary breakfast the next morning, which was a lovely surprise. The room was spacious and comfortable, the breakfast was good, and everyone we met at the hotel was very friendly.We liked the location so close to the Thames, and within easy reach of everywhere we needed to go. we'd happily go back another time.",9-Nov-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"My partner and I stayed here for our 1st anniversary. I expected a little more Alice in wonderland memorabilia than there was so I was a little disappointed.The room was perfect and the staff were so helpful. The room came with a mini fridge the contents were free of charge. There were lots of nice touches in the room: a variety box of teas, hot chocolates and coffees, a jar of mints and a bar menu for room service.I can't fault the staff at all. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. ",6-Nov-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"Hotel staff were lovely. Great selection of amenities in the room: Iron, fridge, lots of power outlets, kettle.

"We thought the Mad Hatter was excellent. It’s just round the corner from Southwark Tube Station (Jubilee Line) and only a moderate walk to London’s attractions via Blackfriar’s Bridge. The food served for dinner in the pub is very good and the rooms are a decent size and comfortable. Reception was happy to look after our luggage on check-out day, giving us a few extra unencumbered hours before heading home. Highly recommended.

Fun and easy to walk from this point over Blackfriar Bridge. The price included items from a free mini bar that was quite nice. The room was a little small but clean and comfortable.

"This hotel is in a great location and is definitely value for money. I have definitely found my go-to hotel in London from now on! Easy to get to, clean, comfortable beds and spacious room.

"I stay in loads of hotels with work and this is definitely a good one! Despite its busy location, my room was sooo quiet! I love that the room comes with free drinks (in fridge) as I don’t drink tea or coffee, so always end up buying water etc. I had room service, there was a problem with my order but I didn’t mind as everyone was so friendly and it was fixed really quickly. The room was dark, the bed was comfy and it was clean. Can’t really ask for more than that...I’ll be back!

"Stayed one night at the Mad Hatter which I selected due to its location, very close to meetings the next day. I was absolutely impressed! Everything was perfect and designed to make the guest feel welcome and pampered. Check-in with Nikki at reception was peasant - she was very friendly and helpful. My room was large and the bed was high with a mattress you could drown in- super comfortable and lots of pillows. Shower was great and very hot water. Tea and coffee (and biscuits) provided and also a mini bar stocked with a selection of soft drinks - all complementary!! Cant ever remember staying at a hotel with a free minibar! Bathroom large and well appointed. Hairdryer (real one, not those small ones that don't blow hot) and iron and ironing board, and mini-safe in the room. Inside chain bolt on the room for extra security. All really nice and tastefully decorated. Very clean.Breakfast the next morning was no less enjoyable - super-friendly waitress offered us cooked options and a selection of cereals, cheeses, toast etc were available from the buffet. All excellent. Pricing for the Mad Hatter is very reasonable for a central London hotel. Unfortunately I didn't have time to eat in the pub - the meals looked fantastic but I was there for just a short stay. I will certainly return if I get the chance - will even go a little out of my way to stay here in future even if my meetings are not so close by - it's worth it!",20-Oct-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"The hotel is a very convenient, easy ten minute walk away from the Blackfriars underground station. The rooms are awesomely equipped for business travellers with iron and ironing board, kettle, coffee and tea if you don’t have the time for breakfast. Furniture is cosy, bed very comfortable. Reception staff is outstanding.The downstairs Fuller’s restaurant provides the perfect English pub experience with a good selection of pies and beers. Reasonable prices both in the hotel and the restaurant.",19-Oct-18,The Mad Hatter Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d209152-Reviews-The_Mad_Hatter_Hotel-London_England.html
"We loved our stay at the Mad Hatter Hotel! The staff was friendly and it was close to two tube stations, which made travel through London a breeze. We also found the decor of the room really cool and the history behind the location. Our only complaint was that the cleaning of the room was hit or miss.

"Recently stayed at the Mad Hatter Hotel and i can 100% recommend it and look forward to my next stay. Good location, very friendly welcome. Niki was great on reception and helpful. Nice clean room with a good mini bar and a quiet room so had a great sleep. Great bar downstairs with a really good choice of real ales. Lovely Breakfast and great service.

"To be honest I only booked this hotel purely because of the proximity to the venue I needed to be at in the evening. It is literally 2 minutes from Blackfriars Bridge train station. However....Now we have stayed here, we will definitely be back. Ideal for a quick overnight in the nicer weather and a stroll along the Thames which we have planned.Easy checking in. I had already paid in advance and rang to see if we could have a fan in our room ....which was done...thank you. The bedroom is not the biggest but certainly ample space for one night. The bed and pillows were uber soft and comfortable. The bath was just the right size for a shorty ( me!) to relax in. Hot water was spit on heat too. Himself used the shower and said that was good too.Lots of little nice touches in the room. Complimentary drinks, plenty of tea bags, a cafetiere of coffee ( ) and biscuits too.Breakfast was reasonable priced as was supper the night before. It's seems to be a very busy and popular pub / hotel. My only comment would be the lack of bar staff on a Friday night left us waiting for ages to be served and ages to get the drinks. Prices not too bad really but a great pint of London Pride....apparently himself said. Our friends stayed here with us too. All in all a successful evening. Thank you.

"Stayed at this hotel following our trip to Wimbledon Ideal location , very clean there were 3 of us, we were given a room with a single bed in a separate part of the room which was great The only complaint I have is we were woken by a member of staff hoovering leaves up on the decking outside our room at 6.15 !!! It was quickly sorted when we rang the receptionOtherwise no complaints I would strongly recommend this hotel ",11-Jul-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"W14 was a very good 3 star hotel. The triple room was small for 3 people for 9 nights, but it was ok. Very clean. Good beds, tv, nice sheets. Plenty of outlets for 3 people to charge phones, and one place could just plug in usb charger. Rainfall shower head was nice. Didn't really like the shampoo and wished I had brought my own and conditioner, but not a big deal. Very good blow dryer in the room. Breakfast was ok but went out for full breakfast a couple of mornings to change things up. I would stay there again. It was very convenient to tube stops and not far from a lot of restaurants, but a very quiet street. We were on ground floor in the front and there was no traffic or other noise.",5-Jul-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"I stayed here for 2 nights on our recent trip to London and the hotel was ideal. It was close to the underground which took you into the centre of London or when we felt energetic we walked in which took us about 1.5 hours. The rooms were spotless and beds were very comfortable. The hotel is in a quiet location so there is very little noise from the street. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was good with a choice of different cereals, fruit, croissants and pastries. The hallway in the hotel are in need of redecoration but I think this is in progress as there was decorating going on while we were there. The only downside to this hotel is there are no elevators so it wouldn't suit if you have mobility problems",5-Jul-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Firstly, all the hotels in London are small. I loved my solo room it served its purpose with a comfortable bed, a hot shower with two shower heads to choose from. The hair dryer was great. The room provides a Heating/ Cooling unit. The ladies who prepare the breakfast are very friendly and welcoming and provide a great breakfast selection. The reception crew are very welcoming and provide assistance for any of your travel requests. Would stay again with no hesitations.

The W 14 kenniston is a great hotel. Quiet area and affordable. Very clean and comfortable. Includes a continental breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful.

"Normally these places (hotels made out of converted houses in residential streets) tend to be poor. This place is anything but. I was on my own for a business trip to London which I do weekly, so I get to stay in some proper dives, as I have limited budget, but this place is priced about right, if anything good value. The room I had was on the basement level facing the front. At least there weren't bars on the windows. I could hear people walking past at street level, which is an indication of how quiet it was...I was amazed. It was a sunny summers evening and I could hear the swifts chirping away to one another - very nice. There was a bit of noise later on, when the laundry was picked up, and again when staff came out to get something from the lock-ups outside the window, but nothing too onerous.The bed was very comfy - I slept very well. My room had a double and a single bed so it would have been perfect for a small family too.The en-suite was big and very well appointed. They provide soaps and stuff but I prefer to use my own, and the towles were big, clean and fluffy! The shower was powerful, and very well done, in fact full marks all around for the fit, finish and decor, and everything worked, including plugs by the bedside table for charging stuff overnight (little things eh?!)I don't do breakfast but it was included in the price which was another nice surprise. I had a wonder around the restaurant area (its only used for breakfast, no evening meals, you'll need to find your own) and it looked well laid out, plenty of seats, and some outside space for the sunny mornings, and bean-to-cup coffee (most important)I had a coffee in my room, so theres a kettle and all the usually stuff like tea bags, instant coffee etc.So, quiet, comfy, safe, well appointed, and only 5 mins walk from Barons Court Tube.Will use again if I can get a room!NB: If this review has been interesting/informative please like/thumbs up.",20-Jun-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"The hotel is in the middle of a residential area (tube stations (Barons Court and West Kensington) are a 5-6 minute walk away). Good value for money given the location, better rooms than most London hotels in this price range and some very helpful staff make this a good choice. Special word of appreciation for Oleg and the other staff on duty during our stay who were extremely helpful and friendly. The fifth star is for them. The breakfast selection is ok but can’t really crib about it at this price point. Bear in mind that there are no elevators in the property.",17-Jun-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

"The room was clean and had everything I needed. The bathroom was very modern, even though it was small. The entire room was small, but it was good enough for me. The heat/AC worked well. However, the Wi-Fi was very weak. I don't know if that was because of the location of my room, but it was very spotty and connection was only decent whenever it stayed connected. Overall, I would recommend this place as a budget hotel for anyone traveling that doesn't want to stay at a hostel. Closest train station is ""West Kensington"" and it is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel",29-May-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I don't usually stay in 3-stars, but my room was clearly worth at least 4 stars. A lot of luxurious touches (in my opinion). A very good mattress, giving one of the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel. (Great pillows, too.) Black-out curtains, so no early wakening. I was on my own, but they gave me a very spacious room with a big double bed (and another spare single). Great bathroom with generous proportions and a fantastic rain shower (with extra hose). All very clean. It's exactly as it looks in the photos - everything looks brand new, right down to the carpets. The road itself is very quiet - you can't believe you're in London. A very nice, quiet area, yet a really short walk from the tube - practically round the corner. The staff were all very friendly and ready to help in any way. Breakfast was included, which is a bonus these days, so I wasn't expecting much, but what I found was a nice, spacious light-filled dining room with a generous come-again buffet. You could stuff yourself, if inclined. I had cereal, toast, juice and fruit, but I could have had croissants, meat, cheese, yoghurt and much more. Endless tea, coffee and juices. Great service from staff. I'll definitely be back and it's on my list of favourites.",16-May-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

"The hotel is down a quiet residential street a little bit out of the way. I stayed in a petit single room. It was fine for the night just for me. The room was off the stairs though which was a bit odd. The room was en-suite with an extra door you could close between the door in to the room off the stairs and the section with the bed. I’m glad there was - people weren’t that quiet going up and down and I felt a bit vulnerable. With the extra door closed it was ok.Reception were very helpful - they lent me a phone charger because I’d forgotten mine.Breakfast was ok, not the best but perfectly acceptable, it’s served in a cabin in the garden and it’s nice they do have outside space it had furniture out there so you can go outside.Overall, I would consider staying there again.",6-Apr-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

It was reasonable, clean, stylish and the rooms were well appointed, the staff were very helpful and attentive, and also updated all of our booked rooms foe a very small fee which was lovely!

The breakfast included with the room has wide variety; fresh fruits, yogurts, coffee,tea,hot chocolate, toast, ham, cheese... Nevertheless, we’ve noticed taped-up electrical cables in the bathroom and in the main room. Otherwise, everything was fine.

I stayed here to attend the London Book Fair in Olympia and it was around a ten-minute walk, and around £6 / £7 by taxi.

Close the Olympia and great access to tube to other placed. Lots of restaurants and shops close by. Only bad thing i would say is the hairdryer needs a longer lead. I had to sit on the floor to use it otherwise it didnt reach - but only a small thing. Fab place otherwise - so much so i have booked again for my event @ Olympis next year.

"The standards set in this hotel far exceed the cost, and the room and shower is very well appointed. I booked for three nights and had a three person room. It was spacious, clean and the beds had Hypnos mattresses - I had the best nights' sleep I have ever had in a hotel. The rainfall shower was lovely, and I would say the only improvement would be if there had been hooks on the wall for the towels, which would have made it easier with three sharing and they were also mentioned as being the way to prevent the unnecessary washing of towels.Breakfast was included in the reasonable cost, and the buffet was perfectly adequate with choice. The croissant/roll warmer could have warmed them slightly more given the cold temperature outside. The breakfast room is great. Vending machines useful. Equidistant from Baron's Court and West Kensington station making District and Piccadilly lines both within easy reach.I will be back!",3-Feb-19,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

"Travelled solo, really liked the affordable rooms for being so close to central London. Small room I had but it was very clean and comfortable and had everything I needed, well thought out space. Excellent service and greeting.

"Upon arrival this hotel looks great.It’s also close to the London Underground on both the direct and piccadilly line which is the airport line.I was able to store my luggage in there storage room given I got there before the 2 pm check in.Staff were very friendly and happy to give advice and directions.There are however a few downsides 1 there is no lift, so it means in some cases you have to carry your suitcases up 3 flights of stairs.The 2nd downside was I think they might have bed bugs. The first night I was bitten and assumed it was a mosquito, but then the same thing happened again, I raised the issue with staff who mover me to another room however it was much smaller then what I had paid for.Finally the shower did lose pressure, at times it came to a complete stop.Overall whilst not the worst place I have ever stayed it’s not the best and if I had my time over I prob wouldn’t stay there again ",29-Oct-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Stayed for one night. The staff are friendly, and the rooms are clean, in a good state of repair and comfortable. There are no lifts, only stairs. I was on the 3rd floor. People with heavy big suitcases will struggle.The breakfas room is the usual self service buffet affair, but I was disappointed with the pre-prepared toast and kept-warm croissant which were dry and hard. The yoghourt was a big help-yourself bowl kind, not individual servings.My biggest (and my colleagues too) gripe was that the shower didnt work properly but rather suddenly slowed from a gentle cascade to a mere dribble from the showerhead. When I and my colleagues complained the management appeared surprised... neither myself nor my colleagues believe their surprise was genuine, more of a 'B' movie act. Would I stay again? Yes, but I will find my own breakfast next time in the plentiful nearby cafès, and check the water pressure before lathering up with soap!",3-Oct-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Comfortable and clean rooms though they were a bit small. Very friendly staff, they helped me with everything I needed. Breakfast could have been a bit better but it was fine. The last but not least, the hotel is located close to a tube station (actually there are 2 of them which are both for a 5 mins walk) and also many small shops and restaurant are in the area.",1-Oct-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"My wife and I stayed at the W14 for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we had a question. Our room was clean and the bathroom was updated. Best of all, we loved the location. It was convenient as it was close to two tube stations that easily took us to the major points in London and it was walking distance to many good restaurants. While it was convenient, it was still far enough off the beaten bath that it offered a quiet stay.",28-Aug-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Stayed her for one night on business in a single room. The room was small but that is typical for London. It was super clean and thankfully quiet, had a good night sleep.

"Especially for a three-star hotel, it was great. Not too expensive, and in a nice neighbourhood. The subway station is about two streets away, and using this you can be in the centre of London in about 10 minutes. The hotel itself looks gorgeous. It seems like an old fancy English city house from the outside, and the inside is modern and cozy. The reception personnel was exceptionally friendly and gave us all the information we needed on transport in London. They were also patient, since they remained friendly as I didn't understand at all how oyster cards worked :) Our room was beautiful, cozy and clean. The bathroom was nice and modern.Breakfast was simple, but everthing you need is present. The orange juice was obviously a powder though, but the other beverages were good. The hotel also has a nice little terrace outside, to relax, which I liked.",22-Aug-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"My husband and I stayed here several nights so we could be close to our daughter and son-in-law's flat. It was within walking distance, so it was perfect for us! It's a quaint hotel that's been renovated and is located in a lovely neighborhood. The room was tiny but that was fine with us. The rates are quite reasonable by London's standards and the hotel had a homey feel about it. The bed was cushy and nice and the bathroom was magnificent! The shower was heavenly--the best one of our whole vacation, in fact. For the shower alone, I will stay here again. :) We felt very much at home here and will definitely stay again when we travel to London.",8-Aug-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Now I have to travel for business, I've stayed a few times at this hotel. I find it very good value for money, great rooms, some can be a little small, lower ground definitely better, the stairs are a killer.!I find the breakfast spot on and although not your full english, a good quality continental. Free WiFi and last but definitely not least, lovely staff from the breakfast area and most importantly the front desk, you guys are brilliant.Hopefully see you next time I'm back down for work and don't forget my lower floor room this time.....",30-Jul-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
A really great stay at the W14 Hotel. We have recently visited an event at Olympia for the weekend. Really convenient and within easy walking distance to Olympia and the underground. Really helpful staff and a lovely hotel. Very clean and well presented. My daughter is Autistic and the staff went out of their way to make her stay as comfortable as possible. I really liked the breakfast and the self service set up suited our family. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you.,28-Jul-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"We made a very last minute booking into this hotel as we needed somewhere to stay ASAP. They were very helpful over the phone and reception staff were polite and smartly present when we arrived. Free WiFi is available and the room was clean, modern and comfortable - no complaints! Breakfast the next morning was lovely and in a nice area in the garden! Would highly recommend for a London city break! ",21-Jul-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

"My wife booked us into the W14 overnight whilst visiting London for our daughters exhibition with her University colleagues. Having stayed in these types of hotel before, we are a little unsure, because many of them are really not very good at all, despite the cost! But this one was! Externally it looks smart and clean. The chap at the reception desk was very welcoming and smartly dressed. Our room on the third floor (no lift) was obviously recently refurbished, smart and very clean and well presented. The bathroom had a very effective shower and again, everything was immaculately clean. Breakfast was a Continental type and substantial. Everything was very good. Overall we rate this hotel highly and only reduced to four stars because of the lack of lift and a lot of stairs.",4-Jul-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"My sister, daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights in May. The hotel is ina suburban neighborhood on a quiet street close to the Barons Court tube station. Our room was a triple and located on the third floor, which is 3 flights up. No lift. However, the lovely gentlemen at the desk take care of your luggage so that is nice. Make sure to call them to get your luggage when you're leaving. Our room had a queen and a twin bed. The way it is set up, it was as if the twin was in its own separate area. Modern fixtures (rainfall shower head) and we did not need adapters even though we had them. The room was small and clean and we had room for the 3 of us comfortably. Since hotel is located in a neighborhood setting, it was nice and quiet. Breakfast is offered with the stay. The best part is it is located in its own separate building steps behind the hotel next to a cute outdoor seating area. Breakfast options were the standard cereal, hard boiled eggs, pastries... Nothing special, but doable. (We ended up eating at a good cafe around the corner called Cafe Continente. Good food and good prices.)The gentlemen at the front desk were very helpful with suggestions on what to do and when we needed things printed. We three would definitely stay at The W14 again.",18-Jun-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Stayed at this hotel this weekend. What a lovrly find! Staff were so helpful and friendly. It was in such a quiet location. Rooms were clean and modern, not the biggest but comfy beds and had choice of air con. . Only 25mins from kings cross and then about 5 minute walk from West Kensington tube station. Breakfast was fine, continental style and had a coffee machine. My only quibble and it's so small but there wasn't any decaf options with the hot drinks in the rooms or at breakfast which I know isn't a big deal to most but that'sy preferred drink so would have been nice to have some options. .",10-Jun-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html

"Great price in London for this gem of a hotel. Staff was very informative and helpful. Beers available in the lobby, a plus for me. No lift so pack light!

Came to stay for the weekend in London to take an exam with LAMDA which is located nearby. From the minute we arrived they could not of been more helpful and friendly. The rooms are big enough and beautifully equipped with everything you need. Bathrooms with great showers. Beds were amazingly comfortable with crisp sheets. Lots of stairs which may be a downside! There is a garden to enjoy and a separate breakfast room. Breakfast was buffet style. You could leave your luggage safely even after checking out. Barons court is a 6 minute walk so location is perfect. I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.

"We booked to stay for a night on the 26th May. Unfortunately both my Mum and stepmum passed away within four days of each other and we aren’t able to stay as planned as the funerals are consecutive days two days prior to our visit.I emailed the hotel to find out if there was any way we’d possibly be able to have a refund under these difficult circumstances. They responded a day later (in a nutshell) with “Hope you’re doing good!! It is sad about your step mum but I wish we could be more helpful but we can’t refund you.” It appears they didn’t even read my email properly as there wasn’t a mention of the fact it’s my mum as well and a double bereavement.The event we were attending has a non refundable policy and they were compassionate enough to fully refund us, I’d hoped that the hotel might have been the same.",13-May-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"The W14 serves it purpose of a good location hotel no frills at a good price. Great proximity to the subway 3 blocks, and services of good residential restaurants. The beds and lines were comfortable, bathroom linens were threadbare and fraying, the rooms very compact in size. Stairway is very narrow and steep, there are no elevators so if you are not on the first floor, you will have quiet a hike. Overall the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Breakfast is pretty weak in content.",25-Apr-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Overall a positive experience - in a good location, but needs attention to a few fundamental areas.This could so easily have been 4 or 5 stars but the hotelIs unfortunately let down by a few small points that cumulatively lower the standard of the experience as a whole.The welcome was ok - but lacked warmth or sincerity. We asked about the possibility of a late checkout and were told that it is possible but at an additional charge of £10 per hour after the standard checkout of 10:30....when will London hotels realise that this is a significant opportunity? While we were at reception, two other guests enquired about late checkouts - and at typical inflated London prices, anyone with a decent business head should simply absorb the slight extra cost of keeping housekeeping onsite for a couple more hours and offer late checkouts - come on people, it’s a big selling point!The public spaces are fine - relatively recently refurbished, clean and pleasant.Our room (on the ‘lower-ground’ floor) was small but well-appointed, with plenty of options for charging phones and other modern necessities! The hairdryer was a good one (often overlooked in hotels) and the bed (mattress) was decent quality.The details around the room however were rather disappointing:We repeatedly stood on the sharp carpet strip between the bedroom and bathroom - as it had been exposed by the fraying of the carpet.There were a few damp patches in full view on the walls - which should have been cleaned off the wallpaper as soon as they occurred - as they are now a permanent feature.The ‘air conditioning’ is pretty much ineffectual - I tried varying it quite a lot while we were there, to no discernible effect.The tea/coffee selection is pitiful - and would have been barely acceptable ten years ago.The toilet seat didn’t match(fit) the bowl, and therefore moved constantly in use.The bathroom bin lid wasn’t attached and therefore flew off onto the floor every time we used the foot pedal at the base of the bin until we finally got used to it (when we checked out).The shower, on the other hand was fantastic - I will be buying one of these units for home very soon!So in summary - despite the hotel’s accessibility (like most places in London) and almost-reasonable price level, it lacks attention to detail and doesn’t quite feel as welcoming as it should.A missed opportunity - that can be easily rectified by the management team I would say.",18-Mar-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"I’ve been here overnight. The quality of room is surprisingly good for this price. It’s new and nice! Another thing, that I need to stress is the speed of checking in and out. SUPERFAST! Literally, I just came, filled the form and that’s it. The payment is done automatically via Booking.com. I love that, really However, something needs improvement. The breakfast is very modest and not the best quality, but at least somethingAnyway, I probably will come back here ",18-Mar-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Having stayed in a few hotels in the area, also used to live around the corner, thought it would be a standard B&B, and just somewhere to sleep.

"This hotel met most if not all of my expectations. Very modern, newly rejuvenated . Very comfortable rooms. No complaints on the service, courteous and good but nothing extra beyond that .For me traveling to UK, the lack of Full English breakfast was something clearly advertised, but I thought it would be ok for me. But afterwards it bugged by more than I expected. Probably because there were no restaurants close by where I could get full english.The only negative surprise was the lack of elevator, which was something of a disappointment, I had not noticed that in the description. Carrying heavy suitcases between floors after 4 days of shopping with the family was a chanllange",12-Mar-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"Stayed at the W14 hotel for three nights in March for the first time and will definitely stay again. We chose this hotel mainly for it's proximity to Blythe House (at Olympia) and the Picadilly Line. We found the hotel to be much more than just convenient........it was surprisingly modern, clean, quiet, friendly and really well placed for transport (both Barons Court and West Kensington tube stations only a few hundred metres away - giving access to three underline lines for easy travel into and around the city, and to Heathrow).The room, although small (the hotel is in Victorian houses so should not be a surprise) was very well fitted, with modern boutique style furniture, the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in in any hotel, the bathroom was also excellent (the shower probably the best of any hotel) - the room had everything you would expect from a modern hotel.The staff where attentive and friendly. The continental breakfast was adequate.The area was surprisingly quiet especially at night given the proximity to the busy North End Road and Cromwell Road.All in all a great small hotel in a good location - a great find that fits our needs.

"Nothing special but cheap and clean. The rooms are modern and in pretty good condition. The bed was good and the sheets felt new. The location is quiet, close to the Hammersmith Apollo so was good for us.Would be good for families because it's quiet.

I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The bed is comfortable but note that the pressure from the shower isn't great. Also note there are no lifts but the staff were helpful with luggage. I found the rooms very loud with doors constantly banging.Breakfast was extremely poor in both choice and quality.The main reason I would never consider staying in this hotel again is because of what is have mentioned in the title. The person who cleaned my room used my lipstick. I found the attached tissue on the desk where I had left my make up. I am not someone who blots my lipstick in this way so therefore I can confidently say this was not left by myself. On finding the tissue I looked through my make up bad looking to match the colour and found the lipstick right at the bottom of my make up bag so who knows what else was used. I reported this to reception and was told to send an email. I returned to my room at the end of the day to find the remains of the cup of tea I had earlier still on the side.I sent an email to the manager as advised and received an extremely disappointing response where he claims the tissue was left by myself - even though I have made it clear it was not and also that the cup of tea was left there because they thought I was still using it. He is not prepared to look into the matter any further and so he clearly does not take it seriously that his staff cannot be trusted in the rooms not to invade peoples privacy. I asked for the lipstick to be replaced but he refused.If you do stay here I would put do not disturb on the door but really I would advise you not to.,26-Feb-18,The W14 Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d577546-Reviews-The_W14_Kensington-London_England.html
"All of the workers but specially josh, kenzie, Deb, and the manager (sorry I forgot your name) were the absolute best when it came to hospitality, service, and friendliness. Gave my friend and I so many recommendations on what to do around the city and where to eat. When we first arrived they let us store our luggage until checkin time. We stayed in a room with 4 other people and a private shower for us. Everything was clean and the private lockers worked well. If you don’t have your own lock they can provide you one with a 5€ deposit that you get back once you turn the lock in after your stay. I read a review about the “dark bar” and the only time it is dark is at night time lol. They have happy hour Thursday- Sunday in the afternoon and it is a great time as it seems like everyone in the town knows about this place (but not too crowded).

"We stayed at Walrus only two nights but we had the chance to see many of the main London attractions thanks to the central position of the hostel. The only problem is that the hostel is situated close to a railway and the noise could wake you up early in the morning if you are a light sleeper. The breakfast includes toast, cereals, tea or coffee, milk but no hot food. The hostel offers the opportunity to cook your own food in a well equipped kitchen. You can lock your stuff in your room and leave your luggages in a storage. Also they provide you with towels, lockers, adapters and whatever you need. The rooms and toilets are clean. I certainly recommend this hostel if you want to meet new people from other parts of world and visit the city centre without spending too much!",25-Apr-19,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"This hostel is good value for money and great location. The staff were friendly and the free breakfast was a great bonus. I was worried about the noise from the trains because they are right next to the hostel, but it was actually fine during the night! The main downside was the bar was not the social gathering place I expected. It was full of locals, an older crowd, so it was tough to hang out there with other backpackers. I found my bed to be fine, but be warned that in the 22 bed dorm there are some bunk beds pushed so close together that those guests were essentially sharing a large bed with a stranger. I definitely would not have been happy if I had been assigned one of those beds, because it seemed inappropriate and awkward.

It's right near waterloo station, which I thought would be a problem for noise, but it absolutely wasn't. It's in a fabulous location - within walking distance from lots of the tourist hot spots. Breakfast is basic, but has all the things you need. I had a really good time at Walrus in comparison to other hostels, I think it's that homely vibe that I got.

"So I stayed in a 22 mixed bedroom just last week. The overall experience was great! A good breakfast (toast, spreads, tea, juices, cereal...), towels provided for free when asked, lovely staff, great pub downstairs and awesome location - just around the corner from Waterloo station and many other touristic places. The overall atmosphere of the hostel is amazing and I met so many great people during my stay! I would stay here again if the opportunity presented itself. On the downsides: the kitchen was tiny tiny tiny but I didn't really use it so it didn't bother me, just FYI. Also, I feel like the (small) amount of bathrooms and toilets can be a problem if ever you get up and go to bed at the same time as other people. Again, it wasn't an issue for me because I get up earlier than most guests and also go to bed earlier than them. Beds are a bit squeaky so if you have trouble sleeping, make sure to get earplugs, just to be on the safe side ;)",28-Jun-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
2nd time staying at a hostel in London and loved the location of this one.Just behind the embankment under the bridge near waterloo.We stayed only for 1 night and booked with free brekfast included the next morning. Great based all of the rooms had lockers did have to take your own towel shower room was abit naff but done the job.Lovely bar area had free brekfast toast cerial biscuits tea coffee etc great for a kick start for the day and we could even leave our belongings there for the daywill defiantly return all local attractions and tube station within walking distance.,27-Jun-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"Came here the last time I was in London 4 years ago, had a great experience then, and another great experience now. We originally booked an Airbnb, but after our host never came home and didn’t contact us, we had no choice but to find a hostel for the night. The Walrus took us in, got us two beds, free towels, and everything we needed. They’ve done a lot of renovations since the last time we were here, and the place looks great! New beds, more outlets, comfier beds, and new showers. Great breakfast with toast, fruit, cereal (and even soy and almond milk options!), and tea and biscuits. They truly saved us when we had nowhere else to stay!! Thanks guys!!",5-Jun-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"Walrus H. its good located with Waterloo station very close. Its confortable and have a good price. I spent there like 4 nights, but there occured me something. I saved some package in a save spot as told me the mannager and when I went out, there wasn’t nothing there, could be someone took my stuffs that I bought during my eurotrip during almost a month traveling. I sent a mail to the mannager about my case and the answer really surprised me. This place showed me two things really important that you have to be sure when you’ll booking in a place, that its safe and a responsable attention from their workers. In London its a lot of more good places to stay too, I wish for the travelers think that until twice times.",17-May-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I stayed at the Walrus Hostel for only one night. I got a great price for one night, the location was good, right near a tube station where it was easy to get anywhere in the city. When arrived I was greeted by friendly staff. The hostel had great safety features. The bed and the bathroom were clean. The bar was a great atmosphere. I had an accident where one of my items got damaged and the staff fully compensated me while I was back in the US. I would recommend to anybody.",9-May-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I recently stayed at the Walrus as I live on the London Waterloo line to attended a gig at the O2 Arena. Being a 5 minute walk from the station the hostel is ideal for connections to underground/overground. The hostel itself is a bar on the ground floor with a side door providing 24hr access to the hostel. Up a flight of stairs was the kitchen that was compact but well equipped. Each floor had a bathroom and toilet, being able to use any floor. These were clean and tidy, though not top-spec. I stayed in a room on the top floor which accommodated 8 bunks. The room and bedding were clean and comfortable, lockers provided as well as a deposit safe available. In the room there was a single plug with a multiplier for electrical items. The WiFi was free and of a decent speed too. The state were friendly and helpful if you needed to ask anything. One word of caution: the aforementioned connectivity with the railway means earplugs are essential as the hostel is on the edge of Waterloo bridge (i.e. trains running most of the night/morning). With that preparation sleep is easily reached! ",5-Apr-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I enjoyed my four nights at this place. Good bar where you get discounts as a guest, quality free breakfast every morning, and close to Lambeth and Waterloo Tube stations. The staff are extremely knowledgeable about London and and happy to help. The WiFi doesn't reach the fourth floor but works well on the lower floors. It is directly next to the train tracks, exactly where the trains stop and squeaking brakes can be heard loud and clear at any time. The lockers in the rooms are small but they have extra secure lockers that no none but staff has access to.",27-Mar-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"The Walrus was the first ever hostel that I stayed in and i was also on my first solo trip. The staff was nice, the beds were decent (I had a top bunk in a 4 female only dorm - I soon learned top bunk is not for me). Breakfast was basic. Very close to 2 tube stations and other attractions such as the London Eye and Big Ben. I had 3 very noisy roommates, but I know that's not the hostels fault. The only thing I would change is if the bar offered food, other than that I really enjoyed this place.",27-Mar-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
Had a wonderful time staying at the Walrus hostel....great location and amenities....Alex and the rest of the staff were wonderful....so welcoming and knowledgeable of the area....The free walking tour was great...lots of facts and a great way to meet other guests!

"Just south of the The London Eye, The Walrus Hostel is in between two tube stations and in a nice neighbourhood. Comfortable beds in the rooms and an amazing breakfast with a great selection including Nutella. Great staff all around and a great bar where you can meet other guests and locals with really nice furniture as well. Will definitely return.",9-Mar-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"This is a real backpackers hostel, full of soul and personality. Walking through the hallways upstairs made me feel like I was living in a cool old mansion. The whole team is super friendly, and Alex is a champion! The rain showers were big and had plenty of pressure and hot water. They even give free towels. The bar is comfortable, with great drinks, fun music and nice people all around. I slept like a baby every night. There’s a shop right across the street so you could cook in the kitchen if you wanted to. With the food tents along the streets outside it’s more tempting to grab something hot and fresh though. Really close to the Tube, train station, Thames, London Eye and all of the attractions of the city. It was a great stay, and I will definitely be back!",8-Mar-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I have been at the Walrus during my last trip to London and I must say it's a great choice for who wish to stay in the heart of the city in a cheap accomodaton.I have to admit that I'm quite an ambiguous traveller, because I like luxury places while travelling with my husband, and young and budget accommodations if travelling with frends. In both cases I look at details and I always make my choice after reading reviews.On this occasion I was with 5 other girls, so we were looking for a young place full of live. Reviews was good, so The Walrus would have been our place.I must say that the Walrus is the right place to make party. The Pub is full on nice people, nice music and fast service.Dormitory was also nice, but common bathrooms was not always clean, that's why I left a score 4 out of 5. Of course it depends from the good manners of guests, but probably they could organize an extraordinary cleaning service expecially at night.In any case I think it's the best choice in you are looking for an hostel.Top location, close to underground and London Eye.The manager is a gentleman and I knows perfectly how customer sevice works.We strongly suggest this place and you will not disagree.",2-Feb-18,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"Alex and his team warmly greeted us at The Walrus hostel and bar. We had a lovely welcoming where Alex showed us around the hostel and explained a few events that were going on throughout our stay. The hostel was very easy to get to with 2 train stations within a 2 min walk. Only a 5min walk to Westminster Bridge and the London Eye as well as the first stop for many of the city bus tours. The room was clean and had lockers and a small sink. Each floor had a shower and toilet both of which were consistently clean and also the showers looked newly renovated. There was also a well-equipped kitchen. Each morning we had the free breakfast in the hostel bar, which consisted of toast, cereal, fresh fruit, tea/coffee, and juices. In the evenings we would have a drink down in the bar, which was often quite busy and had a great atmosphere. A bonus of staying in the hostel and drinking in the bar was the 15% off as well as 15% off food at the sister pub just down the road. My only qualms about this hostel is that it could get quite loud due to being so close to the train. As I’m a heavy sleeper this didn’t particularly bother me but it did for others. Also, the WIFI wasn’t great, but enough to download emails. All in all, I would 100% go back to the Walrus on my next trip to London. The friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and location are all big positives for me and I would recommend to all my friends traveling here!",17-Dec-17,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I visited The Walrus for drinks with a friend after having walked past on numerous occasions, but having no time to pop in.We were always a bit hesitant to make a special trip as it looked a little run down, and the hostel part put me off, but when we went in, there was a great cocktail menu, curious but lovely furnishings and very friendly staff. We stayed for a second drink... I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area, or waiting for a train at Waterloo!",6-Dec-17,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"Overall, this hostel was good and had all your basic needs. The wifi wasn't strong, but they did had a complimentary breakfast. The staff were friendly, and the rooms were clean.

"This hostel is ideally located on Westminster road, just across the Thames from Westminster Abbey / Parliament, etc. The bar area is really cool looking and is a good place to grab a drink. The facilities / rooms could use an update however. The bathrooms were really outdated and there were only two showers per floor. I recommend waking up early to use them.Our room of 6 was small, but confortable with large storage lockers for our bags. Unfortunately the wifi was very spotty throughout our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the free breakfast (toast, cereal, fruit, juice) was appreciated and good.I would recommend staying here if you're alright with an older place, simply for the great staff and excellent location, if nothing else.

"Really easy to get to from Gatwick using trains. Nice little pub in the hostel where they operate the hostel from. Free breakfast which is basically toast, cereal, fruit, coffee/tea/juice, but it's enough to get you going in morning. Welcoming staff, gave a tour and full explanation of hostel facilities upon arrival. London eye 5 min away.Toilets didn't flush properly sometimes but it's nothing to ruin a stay. I would have liked a locker in the room even though I was in a private.Many small cafes and pubs around to eat in if you like going out to eat.

Super close to the London eye and Westminster with a great bar below that offers a discount to guests. The staff was friendly and offered advice on what to see and places to eat.

"This hostel is in a great location and the staff are friendly and helpful. However, the guests in our room were very loud and inconsiderate, and the wifi didn't work all weekend.

I regret not being able to stay a whole weekend because when I got back Friday night the place was packed and filled with great energy. Too bad to leave at 2am Saturday morning. Womp! Regardless of my short stay, I enjoyed my time here. I will definitely be booking here next time I'm in London! This hostel is conveniently located one block away from the Lambeth North tube station and right in front of a bus station!

"By far the best introduction to London. My phone died and I had no adapter. After many hours of both exploring and looking for the Walrus, I finally found it :) I must have looked sweaty, lost, and thirsty, because I was given a beer right away -haha. Check-in was easy and they have specials for guests. When you get out make a left and go through the tunnel.. It was amazing --there is a venue in the middle of it. After a long night, you can hangout and watch the street artists paint their heart out. If you are looking for a quiet paradise.. This is not it --this place is for the open minded and for those who are truly seeking to submerge into the English culture. Can't wait until I visit again!",8-Jan-17,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I found the Walrus on my first trip to London two years ago, and have been staying there ever since. The building is definitely on the older side, but it's quirky and unique. I've stayed in several different rooms, and they have all been clean and well looked after. Free breakfast is basic, but filling, and having the pub just downstairs is convenient. Aside from the great price, this hostel has absolutely prime location. It's just a few minutes walk from a lot of the major monuments (Big Ben, London Eye, etc.), close to a tube stop and Waterloo station, and I've never seen a reason to stay anywhere else. I would definitely recommend it to budget travelers looking to save a few pounds in London.",23-Dec-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"The Walrus Hostel was so-so, nothing amazing but decent enough for a short stay. The bottom floor is a very busy bar, which is also where you check in. Bar has good prices, but was too busy for my opinion and didn't seem to be all hostel guests. There was no common room besides this area.The room itself was fine, bed was comfy with bedding and towels provided.Showers were okay as well but no space or hooks to put your items. Overall the hostel seemed a dated. Also, if you are bothered by train noise then bring ear plugs. It didn't bother me, but I've also spent a lot of time sleeping on trains so I can sleep through the noise.Breakfast in the morning was quite nice - bread, cereals, fruit, coffee, juices, etc.For the price of £26 you can't really beat it. But if you are looking for a more modern, updated hostel then this isn't it.",16-Dec-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"I stayed in the hostel for three nights.The building i charming, rooms are a clean and despite the train I managed to sleep decently. Location very handy. Friendly staff. Decent buffet in the morning, nothing handmade.No hangers in the room to hang your coats, and the power sockets not always are closed to the bed.It would take a little effort to improve the overall experience, especially with the toilets and the showers. All the taps I put my hands on were half broken, with leaks and the shower head water didn't want to stay in place, keeping on falling. No heating whatsoever. No bins for paper towels and a generally poor looking environment. Kitchen was handy but poorly equipped, sign with ""free coffee and tee"" but no actual tee was there. Few pans but no decent cooking tools. Also cold room, which is a shame since it could be a nice alternative meeting point for hostel's guests. No markers or labels to to use to put your name on the food as requested. I would keep the music in the bar lower, so people could actually interact more.",30-Nov-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"You absolutely can not beat the location of the hostel. It's a couple streets away from Westminster bridge (how you get to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, etc.) and close to 2 different subway stops. There's a charming bar downstairs and upstairs is where the rooms are. I stayed in one of the 22 bed co-ed rooms and have no complaints. The room was clean, bright, beds were comfy.

"We chose this one because of location and good price. We spend 3 nights in mixed room up to 6 persons. The service is the best thing in here. Rooms are tidy, bathrooms are ok, the bar service and food are pretty nice. Only one problem - this hostel is placed nex to the railroad - and almost every ten minutes you can hear some train passing by. Anyway this is probably my second favourite place to stay in London.",21-Nov-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"This location is perfect--it's right around the corner from the Eye (just checked, 8 min walk according to Google), and in an OK area (not the safest feeling near the train tracks). Rooms are small but cozy, heat worked fine. Lockers at the beds were adequate. Shower was clean-ish, but cold--one of the windows had broken so it kept swinging open so it got pretty chilly in there. Hot water was iffy as well, but adequate for my needs (quick showers are a must for hostels!). Overall this place was nice, I'd stay here again if I needed a spot right downtown. I didn't like that there were not a lot of bathrooms but I never had to wait in line either, and it was pretty busy, so that's probably just my own weird paranoia. This is a pretty decent hostel given the price, but it's really nothing fancy. Would probably stay somewhere else given how great London's tube system is, but if you like being near the river, this place is perfectly good. Bar downstairs is also pretty nice, though they cant pour a decent Guinness which makes me think the bartenders might not be that great on mixed drinks--but it's a cheap kind of hole in the wall feeling place, so again, get what you pay for. Overall this was decent and tolerable, but given how great London transport is, I'd probably never stay here again unless it was New Years and I wanted to be near the Eye. In which case I would 100% stay here if the prices were ok. Also, you can get to the roof if you schmooze your way with the right people. It's a great view up there, but I understand that they dont really want to invite people up to the top for safety reasons. If you get a chance, get up there though!",11-Nov-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html
"Pros - CHEAP, convenient location near Waterloo station, nice staff, good breakfast.Cons - Not having decent wifi is a killer for me. Third floor toilet doesn't really flush and there is no soap to wash your hands, no bath mats outside showers so expect more water outside shower than inside, the mop to clean the water up isn't clean, lots of stairs, The noise from the Waterloo station trains and the noise from the traffic light crossing is VERY loud. People only spend a night or two here so maybe that is why the ratings aren't bad. Staff cleans but the carpet and linoleum simply have to be replaced. No a/c so it could be hot in summer.",16-Oct-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html

The hostel is supereasy to find - once you see the Big Ben or London Eye keep the direction and you wouldn't be mistaken :)) Hostel is at walking distance from many touristic places. What's important for female solo travelers - area nearby is safe, even at evening hours walking alone back to the place. Staff ir helpfull and nice, makes you feel welcome.4-bed female room is located above the bar entrance with people having fun outside, so if the windows are open, it can be difficuilt to get asleep.Breakfast is bacis - bread, jam, nutella, some coffee and fresh fruit.",3-Aug-16,The Walrus Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1514443-Reviews-The_Walrus_Hostel-London_England.html

Had a really lovely stay. Was only there for one night but super convenient as its so close to Stratford station and the staff and facilities were lovely. Would 100% recommend!

"Down in London for 3 days and because of Wimbledon, was unable to stay in the city. Westbridge is my go to for when I'm in Stratford so booked in here for the 2 nights.The room was pleasant enough, though not sure if it's only because I tried working in the hotel this time I noticed it's but the space between the desk and the bed makes it quite impractical to use (with ease). This was room 112.Amenities are still just as good, and it's the gym that truly makes this place shine over the other hotels.Ate in here for the first night as it was late and I'd been traveling/working all day. The menu has changed since the last time I was down, so got to try a few more delights.Opted for the confit duck to start, followed by the fillet steak (with a side salad), and finished with the triple chocolate cheesecake. All in very pleasant. It's a shame it's not licenced, but I can live with that.Breakfast is the same buffet style that I've come to know when in London. They don't appear to have takeaway cups in the dining room at breakfast so unable to grab and go (though I think you could ask the waiting staff).All staff are pleasant and overall it was a very enjoyable stay, and will remain my go-to place when in Stratford.",6-Jul-19,The Westbridge Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3398027-Reviews-The_Westbridge_Hotel-London_England.html
"In looking for a place to stay the night, I loved the look of the hotel, but was convinced when I learnt it was fully halal. The hotel is well situated- only a few minutes walk from Stratford Station and Westfield. It has a garden and a beautiful lounge, a delicious breakfast buffet, and a room which is well considered in its amenities. The staff were really friendly, helpful and considerate. My husband surprised me by upgrading us to a suite and as each one is different (which I love) the staff really kindly showed me the available suites so I can choose which one I wanted to stay in. I chose the King Edward Suite as this was really spacious although faced the main road which wasn't really a problem. They provided us with a cot for my 2 year old daughter and brought up extra bedding and towels for her. The only only downfall is that the hotel does not have its own parking but there is parking nearby and a stay here is worth the trouble.",5-Jul-19,The Westbridge Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3398027-Reviews-The_Westbridge_Hotel-London_England.html

Staff were very welcoming, and stored luggage for us before check in and after check out. Breakfast was a real treat, self-service buffet style, with plenty of choice.

Restaurant menu limited but what we had was cooked perfectly. Pleasant courtyard to have morning g coffee. Beautiful lounge, with computer for your use. Five minute walk to Stratford shopping centre which was excellent plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. Tube station near too, seven stops to Covent Garden. Get Apple Pay and save on ticket prices. Parking, we used JustPark and parked at Stratford shopping precinct , easy to use cost £23 for two days. We walked to the Olympic village took about 10-15 minutes.

"The Westbridge Hotel is well located near the Stratford shopping center en the Olympic Stadion. The hotel is charming, staff is very professional and even the rooms have everything you need. So why only a 3 star instead of ... much more?Well for a 250+ EUR/night room you expect the rooms to be bigger. The rooms are extremely tiny, with all the luxury you need, but all packed in a tiny, tiny zone as if you sleep in a caravan. So don't go there if you tend to be claustrophobic.",3-Jun-19,The Westbridge Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3398027-Reviews-The_Westbridge_Hotel-London_England.html
"Stayed for 1 night. The hotel is modern, beautifully clean, comfortable and the rooms are lovely. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and the rooms had everything I needed and looked stylish. We had a late lunch after check in, which was delicious and good value, and equally the breakfast was beautiful. I was aware before arrival that this was a halal hotel and therefore no pork products in the breakfast, but it made no difference to me as the selection of food on offer was much wider than I had expected and the quality of the food was amazing. There are signs saying you can bring your own alcohol if wanted. Every member of staff we came in contact with was very polite and friendly.

"Overall it was a good experience, however the room was very small and there was no dresser. We were able to get extra hangers and the two closets did ultimately work for us. The large balcony/terrace was a nice bonus. The Westbridge Hotel was close to public transportation, but a little far from the city of London (sightseeing areas), it was about a 25 min train ride. Our stay here was pleasant, the restaurant food was very good; however this is a 'dry' hotel so they do not serve any alcohol. It you want a drink with your meal or in your room, they do allow you to bring your own. From this hotel to London Heathrow airport it took about an hour and 15 mins by taxi and cost 78 pounds ($101). You can get to the airport by train very easily 'IF' you are not dragging more that 1 suitcase per person. Cheers!

"At first impression the hotel is really nice and well presented with efficient and friendly staff. The restaurant food is good although the menu is restrictive (especially formstays more than couple of days) and breakfast is turkey bacon not pork. The rooms although very modern lack space. The fancy electronic display air conditioning seems to make no difference what ever you set it too. I’ve stayed here for over a month so know this applies to all rooms. The biscuits in the room get replaced everyday but the water doesn’t, might do if you asked but shouldn’t have to. Some nice touches and great staff though. Would stay again and for the area is very well priced. Handy for rail links and the tube.

My husband and I stayed in London for a few days and stayed at the Z hotel city. Our room was in the basement and it was a bit of a surprise when we saw the compact and window-less features of our room. But we adjusted easily and the complimentary wine and cheese every evening more than made up for it. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful to us. The rooms and building were very clean. We really loved the area the hotel was situated in and how close it was to the Temple metro station.

The room was smaller than expected (as advertised) however for a short stay that was not a problem. The cleanliness, the welcoming staff and the complimentary cheese and wine more then made up for the room size. Lovely big TV also.Would definitely book here again.",7-Jul-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"The Z Hotel is a fantastic hotel in a central location. The rooms are clean, accommodating and come with a range of facilities included such as tea/coffee, tv, toiletries and water. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are fitted with Air Conditioning. An added bonus is free wine and cheese in the evenings from 5pm to 8pm. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, I could not recommend this hotel more.

"I spent one night here whilst I was a conference at the Law Society in Chancery Lane. The hotel was about 3 minutes walk. When I arrived I was to,d that they were upgrading my room to the accessible room I had requested. Room 19 was fabulous, lovely view of a Temple Church. Wonderful room with a great shower. Good mirror and hairdryer provided. The free cheese and wine was a lovely touch. I took the wine to my room and drank it while changing for a black tie dinner. I slept very well. I hadn’t paid for breakfast but went into the cafe attached to the hotel and was able to order what I wanted. The staff were absolutely superb. If I’m at a conference and need to stay in London I would definitely stay there again.",16-Jun-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"Booked through company for a week for me to work in The City.Based on Fleet Street, it was a pleasant 45m walk along the river, 20m walk to Covent Garden and St Paul's Cathedral.I was a bit worried about having a room without windows but, I was in the basement so understood the layout. Needn't have worried, Ron was well laid out with air conditioning. It also encourages you to head out.While there is a place to eat, you are in a cafe that will be frequented by commuters. I used it once but decided to use a cafe in the office campus I was working in. Just like the other hotel I stayed in the previous week, there are plenty of pubs.Check in and out was very efficient, staff always said hello. Room was clean, always fresh everyday. Very important, the glass pod shower room was fantastic.Very comfortable place to stay.Gripe? The lack of a decent desk to get that last hours work crammed in.

On arrival to the Z hotel staff were lovely polite & let us keep our cases there till we could check in . First impression lovely clean hotel Once checked into the room couldn’t believe how small it was. Three adults had to share this room . When you walked in the door bathroom was on the left bunk beds the right . No room to move about . The toilet door was frosted but you could see through it . My mom was not impressed . The steps to the top bunk were not the best & the bottom bunk we kept banging our heads on the top. We struggled to get ready for our west end show ! This room is one person two at the most . It was clean & had plenty of tea / coffee / hot choc but the room was a big dissertation a shame really has the hotel itself was in a great location & the free cheese & wine on the night was a lovely touch . The breakfast was a buffet style hot food toast & pastries .. was lovely . If your ok with being in each other’s faces & bearing all in the toilet ha ha then this is a good hotel not very good for more than 2 people & again the bathroom door could of been more frosted ! ,15-May-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Great from start to finish.easy booking.Arrived early but were able to leave bags.On return our bags had been taken to room and we had cheese and wine.Every member of staff was chatty and helpful.Room was clean and comfortable.We have stayed before and will be staying again.,13-May-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"My boyfriend and I have visited this specific Z hotel several times, I have also been with family. We were apprehensive to visit at first due to the size of the rooms, however, the hotel is so clean and tidy. Even though the rooms are very compact and quite small, they are all you really need when visiting London. The beds are amazingly comfortable. Having Sky TV is also a bonus! The location is perfect, when we visit here, everything for us is in walking distance, however the nearest tube is a very short walk away. So really location is perfect. The staff are always so welcoming and cannot do enough for you. Able to leave bags in storage upon check out if you are staying in London after checking out! Don't hesitate to book this hotel if you do not mind compact rooms, because you will not be disappointed! My boyfriend joined the Z member's and that offers deals, which make the price even more reasonable. We always stay here upon our visits to London! The ONLY thing if we were being picky would be the breakfast is quite expensive when there are cafe's down the road which are cheaper, but it is a lovely place to eat, and in the evenings they offer FREE cheese and wine which is always lovely!",8-May-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"When we arrived there was a fresh pitcher of complimentary ice tea to sip at while you’re checked in - which was very nice as it was very hot when we arrived. All the staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much to ask. The rooms are on the small side but for a city break that’s all the room you need as you don’t spend much time there anyway! However, this doesn’t take away from the fact that the rooms are very stylishly decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The room was also equipped with a large flat screen tv (with sky and all the catch up channels), air conditioning, a water jug, a kettle and a variety of teas, coffees and hot chocolates to choose from. The free cheese and wine from 5-8 was amazing and we were there every night! They’re not at all stingy with wine and staff even come to the table to ask if you want a top up, and you can have as many helpings of cheese, bread, grapes and chutneys as you like. You can even take your wine to your room if you don’t want to drink it in the dining room. My only wish is that we were given more coat hangers as there was 4 coat hangers in a room so we only got 2 each - but apart from that I can’t fault it. We had an amazing stay and are looking forward to staying with them again.",26-Apr-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"Myself and 3 friends booked a family room for one night while in London to see a show. When we first walked in, we thought, OMG!! We will never fit!! BUT we did, and although it was a tight fit with cases etc, the beds were wonderfully large (bunk beds) room was spotless, free water, tea, coffee and toiletries. Large enough shower, staff very helpful and friendly! Offered the free cheese and wine but we had dinner booked already. Only pre warning I would give is if you are sharing a room, make sure you are all very close and not shy! The bathroom glass is pretty much see through enough that you can see whats going on! Luckily we were a close group of girlfriends so could laugh about it! :)",20-Apr-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"First stay at a Z Hotel, for business on a weekday in the City.Pros:Very comfy bed, big TV, excellent en suite and shower, staff very welcoming and helpful on front desk. My room had a second queen sized bed on a mezzanine over the floor level bed: could be fun for families for a one night novelty. Complementary wine and cheese 6-8pm is a good idea. It's a slightly bigger bedroom than Bloc Hotel, Birmingham - I haven't tried Premier Inn's Hub format yet, but am keen to.Cons:It's not the sort of bedroom you would want to spend much waking time in, particularly if there is more than one of you: if you want that sort of room, book a Premier Inn or other hotel with conventional larger rooms. Breakfast was in a cafe next door (run by Z Hotel) - not as good as PI, but still not bad.I will return for business trips.",15-Apr-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"Don’t be fooled by the photos. The rooms are the smallest I’ve ever seen in my life. The bathroom eats up half of the room (see attached photo). Can not express how small they are !!! They were clean and the beds comfy, but with 2 people staying in a room, we were climbing all over each other and no room to relax and enjoy.

"My husband and I paid £60 for a room on a Sunday night which is AMAZING value for central London. Yes, the room was small but it was spotlessly clean and because it didn't have a window and was underground (level -1), we had a brilliant night's sleep with no disruption from sunlight or traffic noise. We also loved the complimentary wine and cheese from 6-8pm. We have enjoyed similar perks at hotels in America but they have never been as good as this. There were several cheeses to choose from as well as olives, bread and chocolate - and the staff kept coming round to top up our wine! I would definitely stay here - or indeed at any other Z Hotel - again in future.",26-Mar-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html

"Convenient for those coming from Gatwick as it’s walking distance to Blackfriars station, one of the stations you can get a train to/from Gatwick. It’s also a great location with respect to taking Ubers.

"We paid for a standard double with no window but we’re lucky enough to get a family room with two double beds stacked on top of each other, we didn’t need the extra bed but it was nice. Having sky tv was a really good addition! The room was just big enough for 2 and the shower was great and the room was clean and comfy. Complimentary coffees and tea was fabulous. Really central location and about 7 mins walk from temple, would definitely stay again for the night!

"The only reason I have given this hotel 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the size of the room. The location was superb and considering how central this hotel is, it was incredibly quiet and I had a great night’s sleep! Sky TV was a great bonus as was the complimentary water and hot drinks. The room was spotless and a real luxury to have fluffy towels in the bathroom! By far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in in London for business. The only downside is the size of the room and if you are claustrophobic this is not the hotel for you. However if you are looking for luxury at a reasonable price and just looking for somewhere to spend a couple of hours at the end of a long day then I thoroughly recommend! The staff were also extremely pleasant at the front desk. ",28-Feb-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"I expected a small room but not so small that my feet touched the wall when i slept (I am only 6’ 3”). Very cramped - you could not get two people in this double room (317). Amenities good, great shower and toiletries but the TV did not work in the room. I mentioned the TV but it was not repaired for my second night’s stay - very disappointing. No compensation offered. The Hungarian lady in the Z cafe was superb - very helpful and delightful company. I wish the desk staff were as helpful and got the TV fixed. Assuming all the rooms are as small as 317, i will not be returning.",8-Feb-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"First and last visit - it tries to be like Citizen M hotels I.e small and chic cubicle rooms, but instead it is more like Stalag 17. I was put down in the basement - claustrophobic and gloomy. Does not have, drawers, wardrobes, Bath, biscuits, iron, laundry, safe, phone etc etc etc - I guess that it’s like ‘doing time’ at Ford Open Prison.All kinds of moaning and groaning from pipes, aircon etc, plus can hear the neighbours movie on their tv.Positives: nice staff, free wine (OK) and cheese (good), good location - these are the only reasons that I could consider giving a second star.I’m typing this at night, hoping that the neighbour’s movie will finish soon and that I might sleep.

"Travelled to London for an overnight stay with my daughter and had a great trip! We knew from the start that the rooms were going to be small from the hotel's description (which would appear honest) and trip advisor reviews, but was intrigued by the concept and was not disappointed, we both absolutely loved it!!! The room was small but modern, loved how all the space was efficiently used, totally comfortable bed, wide screen TV on wall, clean and modern shower & toilet, tea/coffee facilities, heating/aircon and quiet room! Good shower and toiletries provided. Toilet/shower had glass screen/opaque glass doors, which whilst still provided modesty, may not appeal to everyone (depending how familiar you are). Wall hooks to hang clothes, under-bed storage for small cases (may struggle with larger luggage). Had every convenience associated with larger hotel rooms - just more compact. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. Loved the complimentary wine and cheese served between 5 - 8pm, which was a nice touch. We didn't book breakfast but just paid on the morning which was lovely and so reasonably priced. Lovely, friendly staff. Good location close to Covent Garden and many of the theatres. Overall, loved our stay and would definitely stay again. Thank you..",15-Jan-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Great value. Clean and modern. Cost was good considering in the centre of London and it was 20th Dec. Our room was on the ground floor. Large with a walk in shower. Water pipe were a little noisy but all in all a bargain. Go for it.,6-Jan-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"Friendly, professional welcome at reception. The deco was modern and minimalist and the hotel felt quiet and calm. My room was a double, and the clever use of space in such a small room was impressive and interesting. Bed comfortable, everything very clean, tiny desk, massive tv. Unlike some other reviewers I liked the en suite's glass walls, it was private but didn't feel claustrophobic like some of the ""plastic pods"" can get. Nice and clean, powerful shower, fluffy white towels and not a hint of damp. Breakfast was ok, the dining room was interesting but the choice was a little limited. I was unlucky in that the salmon and boiled eggs I'd fancied from the menu weren't available. Unfortunately I didn't have a great night's sleep because I couldn't get the temperature warm enough without leaving the noisy air con/heater thing on all night. When I turned it off there was an icy blast still coming through.All-in-all I think that this was a very functional and comfortable stay for a business trip when you're not needing anything more than a base for showering and sleeping.",5-Jan-19,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Stayed 1 night in a double non windowed room. Great very compact bathroom- shower very good.Bedroom was tiny every inch is used very well but there really isn't my inches! Sadly when turning all lights off there was still some sort of alarm led on ceiling that due to compact room and full bathroom wall being glass meant that the room was just too light to sleep properly Couldn't imagine sharing this room just not enough room to dress in the morning but for 1 night business fine of you travel light and have a good eye mask ,12-Dec-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Me and my mother stayed here for the 1 night as we were seeing a show in the West End. This hotel was well within walking distance and also a 10 min short walk to Covent Garden. The staff were exceptionally friendly and very welcoming. Rooms were a bit on the small side. But fine as we were basically only sleeping in it. Lovely comfortable bed and TV came with Sky. Comes with tea/coffee facilities. Amazing complementary cheese and wine was served between 5-8pm. Overall a lovely stay. Right in the heart of the city and very affordable.,20-Nov-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Sunday night so cheap rate =£85. Very fast check in & was positively encouraged to have free cheese & wine which was a nice touch. Room was very small but really well thought through so felt larger. Wine & cheese was great quality & staff were just really friendly .Bed - fantastic sheets . Shower powerful & nice freebie shower gel . Sleep quality excellent as blackout blinds really blocked light & noise.Nice amenity tray with good coffee bags & hot chocolate sachets Check out was very speedy & they looked after my bag whilst I worked & again bag collection took seconds . Really great place especially if working in the Royal Courts of Justice but brilliantly central for tourists too. As with all London hotels the rates are higher mid week but this hotel ticks the boxes for giving a stress free stay ! Will definitely stay again when working in area .

"I stayed for 1 night in London...The Z hotel is a stay of luxury. All staff that we encountered were exceptionally polite and professional. The rooms are small - correct - but are perfectly designed to include everything that is necessary. The standard double room I stayed in is ideal for either 1 person or a couple (if you don’t mind being close with them).The bathroom was separated from the room with elegant, tinted sliding doors that gave a classy, modern feel. The shower was very impressive- black glass/tiles that made it seem brand new! The cleanliness of the room and bathroom was faultless. I personally cannot stand an unclean room, so for it to impress me was a plus! The appliances were all top quality and again seemingly brand new. A huge flatscreen was sunk into the wall directly in front of the bed, and was using sky so I was able to watch any programme (movies for me). Breakfast I payed for when I checked in and it was lovely! A wide range of hot and cold foods were set out in a buffet style for you to help yourself to. Luggage room proved useful the next day to save me and my friend dragging cases around the tubes! This was also free of charge! 24 hour reception is always a comforting addition especially as it was my first time staying in London!Will definitely be returning to a Z hotel.Thank you",28-Oct-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
Great 3 star hotel the Z hotel City in London.

"We were not expecting much as this is not a pricey hotel and is obviously small and meant for shorter trips. Traveled with a friend and reserved two rooms, the staff was great, very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are very small but this is be expected when reserving single rooms. Both of our rooms were very clean, well decorated, cozy and considering the small space were laid out quite well, plenty of storage and hanging space. We only stayed 3 nights so for short trips and traveling solo I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location was perfect and very accessible to all of the great sites in London. I will absolutely stay here again and have zero complaints.",2-Oct-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"My partner booked this hotel for us for a theatre weekend in London staying Friday 21st and Saturday 22nd September. First of all the location is great, it really is a base for you to explore, Covent garden and the theatres are literally a 10 minute walk away and with plenty to see along the way it's a nice little stroll. The tube is the same about a 10 minute walk and from here you are around 2 stops away from Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street and with a simple change onto the Victoria Line you are at St Pancras very quickly if this is where you need to travel to/from. First impressions of the hotel were great, extremely clean, it smells amazing when you walk in that was one of the things we first picked up on! The check in staff were lovely and the process was quick and simple. I had obviously done my research into this hotel and it is very clear that this is a modern space spacing design. We had booked a room without a window which was perfect for us, but perhaps if you are claustrophobic it might not be the best idea! We stayed in room 615. Extremely clean, very cosy with the large TV equipped with all sky channels is fixed to the wall directly opposite the bed and we loved this. There isn't a lot of floor space, but again this is expected, if you hang your clothes on the hanging wall and store things down the side of the bathroom area, it's easily done if you are only staying a couple of nights.I have seen mentioned before the fact of the frosted glass bathroom area, I know from responses this is to create the illusion of more space, however if you are staying in these types of rooms, you need to be extremely close to your partner/friend/family member as you can see everything and hear everything and I really mean that, there is no privacy whatsoever. Luckily this wasn't an issue for me and my boyfriend but if you have only been together a short amount of time, it may be! The view of your companion sat on the toilet is literally a stones throw away as you relax on the bed. Rooms had a kettle, two large mugs, tea bags, coffee, hot chocolate sachets and sugar/sweeteners. I myself only drink decaf so the sachets of nescafe decaf coffee were a very welcome sight, however I really would like to see hotels introducing decaf tea bags as not many do.If I had to make a comment on anything that was slightly inconvenient, again I have already seen this mentioned, there is one single light that is a green colour and it is the only light that doesn't turn off, I personally am someone who likes complete darkness when I sleep and this is quite off putting as it's almost like having a TV still on in the middle of the night. Also although no fault of the hotel's i'm sure, on the Friday night, our first night stay I was awoken to the sound of someone forcefully trying to enter our room for a good 5 minutes before probably realising they'd got the wrong room number. As we had booked a room with no window we were on the very ground floor and you do get a lot of banging around from people walking around above quite early in the morning unfortunately. These small points where literally the only things that were ever so slightly inconvenient about the whole stay.The hotel umbrella's that were available to borrow were very welcome as this weekend was extremely wet and cold so this was a really useful feature. It was a shame that we didn't find the time to sample the free wine and cheese, but we will definitely be back at some point in the future to be able to do so.Little tip, the pub right next door is lovely for drinks and food. Nice atmosphere and really reasonably priced!",24-Sep-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"This has to be the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, and yet that didn't matter. The space was designed to be incredibly functional, so it had a double bed, a small desk, some hanging space, and an en suite shower room, all packed into an area marginally larger than two double beds. Opening the door took up most of the available floor space, but the room was designed that way - and as it was just me and an overnight bag that wasn't a problem. I was more interested in a comfortable bed (yes), clean (yes), reasonably quiet (yes) and location (yes - right on Fleet Street).If you're in town for a short business stay, definitely book it. If you're here for longer on holiday, or travelling as a couple, the room I had might be a challenge, but worth checking whether they have anything bigger available.",16-Sep-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html

Our first evening we had a most constructive business meeting, ideas boosted by free flowing wine, and our thoughts assisted by the wonderful staff helping with ideas (nothing better than a fresh pair of eyes or three to find new angles)... Probably the most useful meeting we've had! Thank you to Mateus, Dora and the lovely blonde lass who's name escapes me (too much wine?).

"This hotel is very centrally located. The queen room we booked was beyond tiny. Access to only one side of the bed. No shelves, luggage space or room to move. Very modern. Staff are exceptional.

The shower was good, large enough and plenty of hot water, big tv with free sky, bed was large and comfy, bit tight to get round and hang up your clothes, location was perfect for the shows and that is what we wanted, another good point was the ‘free’ unlimited wine and cheese from 5-8 pm, bargain you can top up before going out! The breakfast was under £10 each, not bad but more continental than good old fashioned full English, staff were very helpful and friendly, I would say it’s a convenient bed for the night, maybe 2 but probably would stay here a week...",26-Aug-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html

"The cost of my single room was £110 for the night including breakfast. Given the incredibly central location, I felt this was very reasonable. The room was extremely clean and quiet, with a comfortable bed and nice touches (a bottle of water in the room, some toiletries, etc). It was incredibly small but absolutely fine for what I needed (and was advertised as such), and had effective air con. Customer service was very good, and I was given a complimentary glass of wine which was an unexpected bonus! They were happy to store my suitcase for the day once I'd checked out, too. The breakfast was fine - quite tasty scrambled eggs - though I hadn't realised it was essentially in a cafe that's open to the public, which meant it was rather busy. I would definitely stay there again if I needed to be in that location and it was still the best deal on offer at the time.",8-Aug-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"This hotel has a fantastic location for Covent Garden, the City and the Aldwych and is opposite The Royal Courts of Justice, and backs onto The Middle Temple (our room overlooked The Middle Temple and The Temple Church).The reception was friendly and helpful, the room (we were given a free upgrade) was large and comfortable with no unnecessary frills. The en-suite was really well designed and equipped.Every member of staff we met was smiling and greeted us.Most people who visit London for short breaks couldn't care whether the hotel has a chintz-covered armchair. They just want a great shower/bath and a comfortable bed. This hotel certainlyprovides those essentials, and to a high standard.",3-Aug-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html
"My mother and I stayed at the Z for 3 nights in July 2018. First and foremost, the entire staff was, by far, the best I have ever encountered in all my hotel stays. Helpful, polite, always smiling and quick on their feet to carry out visitors' requests. Alessandra in particular (an Italian native) went out of her way to make restaurant and tea room reservations for us. Another unexpected perk was the complimentary wine and cheese offered every night in the cafe connected to the hotel. The selection of cheeses were varied and the choices of wines exceeded our expectations. The hotel is centrally located...a stone's throw away from trendy Soho, a 15 minute walk from Trafalgar Square, a 2-minute walk from the river Thames and Temple Station, 20-minute walk from St-Paul's Cathedral, etc THANK YOU FOR THE MOST ENJOYABLE STAY!

"The only thing that really commends this hotel is where it is, assuming that you have business in that area. The room was not small - it was tiny. It was spotlessly clean but did not have an available drawer or even a shelf (other than in the bathroom) to put anything, and the 'wardrobe' consisted of a series of hooks on the wall. The 'desk' was about the size of a chopping board, taken up largely by a kettle/coffee tray. The bed was comfortable, the aircon efficient and the roll-down blinds effective. The aircon, however, 'spits out' its accumulated condensation regularly (about every 15 mins) with a nosy pump into the loo cistern. At first I though that my neighbor must have been suffering from incontinence, but it was the aircon...all night. The staff are brilliant, and the in-house café has reasonable breakfast and a very pleasant cheese and wine buffet in the early evenings. It is by no means cheap - over 550 quid for three nights - but is less expensive than its immediately adjacent competitor Apex Serjeant's Inn (where the rooms are infinitely better).Not somewhere I would chose to stay again, and certainly not a place for a family.",22-Jul-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html

This is definitely a place for a short stay. Very small rooms but comfortable bed. I had one of the larger rooms apparently and I still felt like the TV was nearly as big as the floor space.

"I know it's Fleet Street but £210 for an 8ft square room with no windows and no breakfast seems a bit less than good value. I seem to remember Easyjet hotels in London being a similar size but they were £10 a night. The walls hug the bed on 3 sides. The floor space that isn't bed is as long as the bed and as wide as the door, so it can open. The bin is under the bed and the kettle would touch your face if you were in bed. But my actual gripe is that there's a green night light over the door so the entire room is bathed in green light all night. The TV is over the bed and set into the wall so you can't turn it off. The red sleep light has to stay on all night 7ft from your face. All the electronic lights do not make for easy sleeping, although if you're afraid of the dark I suppose it might be a plus. There is a free gift, a cloth mouse mat with a map of London design if anybody still uses mouse mats and There is a 3 hour period every night where they provide unlimited free wine and cheese but wasted on me as I don't drink wine. I'd rather have a cheaper room. Or breakfast instead! I wouldn't stay here again unless it was proper cheap. The staff, however deserve real credit. They are friendly and helpful.",22-May-18,The Z Hotel City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d9608180-Reviews-The_Z_Hotel_City-London_England.html

"I was hoping for a good experience from the reviews but this is the best Travelodge I have stayed at. Minutes from Aldgate Tube and in a quiet traffic free street (amazing for London). Rooms were clean and functional with a great aircon system and very quiet with lots of sockets etc. Only tiny negative was the layout of the bathroom was tight between toilet and sink but a minor issue. Nice airy bar and restaurant area and the food, although pre-prepared was hot, tasty and served with a smile and there were plenty of staff on hand. That brings me to the final point. the staff were smiley, welcoming and helpful from the time I checked in until I left after breakfast. A good breakfast at that. Cant single any out but I stayed on the night of 10 July and they were all great. It isnt always that way.

"This is a new(ish) Travelodge located near the financial part of London, and very near the Aldgate and Aldgate East tube stations. It is what you would expect from a Travelodge hotel, clean, a bit basic, but perfectly adequate. I stayed with nights and was more than happy with my room. It was a cosy room and while fine for a couple, it might feel a bit cramped after a while. Some points to note: while there is basic coffee/tea making facilities, there is no fridge so nowhere to store food. This means you pretty much need to eat out. Secondly, there are no laundry facilities so you will probably need to use a local laundromat/laundry or dry cleaner. There is also no safe deposit facility in the room but that isn’t an issue these days with card-only access to rooms.I liked that you had to explicitly say you wanted your room serviced by leaving a sign on your door. If you don’t, then your room isn’t serviced.There is a local restaurant where I had breakfast most days. Pretty cafeteria-like, and there are nicer places around to have breakfast to be honest.There is paid-Wifi for more than 30 minutes. Only two devices though are allowed on the same paid access.I booked well in advance and got a good price - about GBP120 a night from memory, which is great by London standards.Near to two tube stations so very handy. Takes about 20 minutes to get into say Oxford Street.You don’t stay in a Travelodge for style, but this is a very comfortable place to stay for a reasonable price near major transport routes.",9-Jul-19,Travelodge London City hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13569031-Reviews-Travelodge_London_City_hotel-London_England.html

"We stayed at London City Travelodge for one night during a recent trip to London. The room was very clean and tidy, and was perfectly suitable for a short sight-seeing trip.We have previously stayed at the Travelodge in Covent Garden. To compare the two, we would choose the London City branch for future visits. Although the room and bathroom were smaller, the main advantage is that we were able to store our luggage before check-in and after check-out, which we weren't able to do at Covent Garden and was a huge inconvenience. The London City hotel is very close to Aldgate tube station, so it's easy enough to get around and is in a nice, quiet area.The cons of this hotel are that there is not a lot of storage space (which was fine for us, as we were only staying one night), but there is no wardrobe - just a few hangers on a rail. The bathroom is also small and basic-looking, and the breakfast price is far too high, but it's easy enough to head over to the nearby Pret-a-Manger or EAT instead.For a cheaper hotel for a short break, we'd recommend. Comfy, clean and easily accessible. ",8-Jul-19,Travelodge London City hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13569031-Reviews-Travelodge_London_City_hotel-London_England.html

We didn’t use The bar area or restaurant as we went out ... but it looked busy and seemed very good value from the offers on show. We asked staff for more towels and were given them straight away. No problems. Aldgate East tube station is about a two-five minute walk away from the hotel, depending on what entrance you use... I think there’s at least 3 entrances to the station! The only thing that could be improved is maybe providing a bath mat or a smaller towel for people to stand on when they get out the shower. Also there is no mirror in front of the dressing table. Only very small issues and nothing major ....I Would definitely stay again if the price stays at a reasonable rate.

The double room is not big but it's expected for a hotel in London. The big star for this hotel (in my opinion) is its location. Just 2 minutes away from Aldgate station and 5 minutes from Aldgate East station by foot. It's a 10 minute walk to Liverpool Street station which isn't bad at all either. Spitalfields and Brick Lane markets are not far away from the hotel. I took a 30 minute walk to Columbia Road Flower Market on Sunday morning - certainly helped to have lovely weather for that.

Stayed here for 4 nights with two small children. Good location and 2 minute walk from Aldgate station. Room was compact but functional with two sturdy fold out beds for my kids. More and better coffee in the room would have been nice. Room was clean but rubbish was found under the double bed by my four year old.

"perhaps we are easily pleased but our hotel stay on our recent trip to London was great, staff are always super friendly and very helpful, rooms kept clean and smelled fresh, air con a deciding factor to book this particular hotel, the hotel was well located around the corner from Aldgate station and a 10 minute stroll from Liverpool st station, we used to pay a lot for 4 and 5 star hotels until we realised we only slept in the rooms and were out and about all day and into the evening, what's the point of a luxury hotel?",24-Jun-19,Travelodge London City hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13569031-Reviews-Travelodge_London_City_hotel-London_England.html

We stayed here for one night on a recent trip to London as we were going to see a show at the Globe. We checked in through self service as reception was busy. This was fast and efficient and we were in room 8. This was on the ground floor and was surprisingly quiet. The room was fresh and modern and the bathroom was very clean. We opted for breakfast on the Sunday morning. I can honestly say it was the best Travelodge breakfast. The coffee was hot with a very good flavour. The buffet had a good selection and was well maintained. Very tasty sausages. There were 3 members of staff cleaning table who were attentive and friendly!! I would definitely recommend this Travelodge for a few nights in London. ,23-Jun-19,Travelodge London City hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13569031-Reviews-Travelodge_London_City_hotel-London_England.html

"Somehow, I managed to get a Friday night, super room here for £62 which is astonishingly cheap for Central London so my expectations were not high! However, I was so pleasantly surprised! Staff were friendly and helpful, although small, the room was spotlessly clean and well equipped and it was exceptionally quiet. A couple of minutes walk from the Tube at Aldgate and not too far to stroll up to Spitalfields market and beyond into Hoxton so plenty of places to eat, drink and shop nearby.We didn’t sample the restaurant at all but it looked new and nicely done.

"My husband and I were in London with my brother and father to celebrate my dads 80th birthday. We had lost our mom the previous fall and this trip was to reconnect with relatives and some of my dads old friends from the UK. From the time we arrived our experience was top notch. The room my husband and I had was the super saver and was small as expected but we asked if anything was available a bit larger and they gave us an accessible room which is much larger. The room was spotless and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The location could not be any better as it is a 2 minute walk from two different tube stations. There are also plenty of dining options within a 5 minute walk.My dad and brother were meeting us 2 days after us so after telling the host at the front desk our story she offered to decorate their room upon their arrival! I hope I am giving her the credit she deserves as I thought her name was Yasmet but the card she gave me said Sultana, perhaps this is her last name. Also Bagi who was the head of housekeeping helped and the result was incredible. They had specifically purchased 80’s decorations with confetti, balloons and banners and a nice bottle of wine with glasses for their arrival. Talk about 5 star service!We cannot express our thanks enough and highly recommend this hotel. Obviously the service surpassed any expectations but it is also a fantastic value for the rate.

"Had a meeting in Wardour Street the following morning and didn’t fancy a morning rush hour trip on the tube, so looked for somewhere more central. Was surprised to get a night in this place for £155 which in Central London is reasonable compared to other places nearby. Having said that it’s still a rip-off compared to the rest of the UK. Hotel is a modern office block conversation right in the bustling heart of Soho, and very handy for west end theatres etc. Modern well equipped room in a boutique style.

The hotel is strategically located in Central London (Zone 1) and making it extremely easy to navigate around all touristy sites and of course, convenient to shop around Oxford and Regent Streets. The closest tube station is Oxford Circus (Central Line) (not more than 10 mins by foot). There’s also yummy snacks and wines for all guests from 5-8pm daily on the 1st floor. Be sure to be there early to get a table as it gets packed quite easily.

Negative aspects: late check-in from 3 pm, the breakfast room is too small to get everyone seated, they forgot to clean our room even though our door hanger was hanging. When we came back in our room the next evening, we informed the girl at the reception and she assured that someone would bring towels, soap and water but actually nobody came.

"We stayed in the Z Hotel just off Tottenham Court for one Friday night as we were out in the area for a birthday party. If you're looking for a hotel for that kind of occasion, where you know you'll only be in there for a few hours just to sleep, then I would definitely recommend this one given it's price in comparison to most in this part of London.The rooms are tiny and dominated by the bed but the space works well - everything tucks away neatly. The bathroom is clean and modern with a great shower. Good set of amenities for a hotel of this style - various bits in the bathroom and a tray with a kettle and various teas and coffees.Staff at check-in and check-out were friendly and helpful. Special mention goes to the guy at reception when we arrived back at about 2am, somewhat inebriated, who helped us find somewhere nearby to get some late night food!All in all, definitely recommended for a short stay, especially if it's just one person.

The location could not be any better! The rooms are beyond tiny but if you look at the size when booking that does not come at a surprise. The rooms are very clean and modern just no space for anything. Our room did not even have a closet and so it was extremely difficult to figure out where to put our clothes. The room contains the bare necessities and it was difficult coming from 5* hotels to go to not having a robe/slippers and hair dryer. You can see and hear everything going on in the bathroom which was fine for me but I would not recommend staying in these rooms with someone you are not super comfortable and close with because you will see and hear everything.,13-Oct-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html

"Amazing hotel, yes the room is tiny but the value was great and it has everything you need. Excellent location. Love the cheese and wine evening. Staff were friendly. Would definitely go back to this restaurant.

We stayed here during a recent visit to London. We have stayed in Z Hotels before but never this one as this is reasonably new.Arrived Early and managed to leave bags until we were able to check in. Went back later in day and managed to check in early due to room being ready.Hotel rooms same as other Z Hotels and we opted for the Queen Option. Small rooms but great for a short stay.Café Bar on first floor where we had the Free Cheese and wine before going out for the evening.Location is great just a few minutes walk from Carnaby Street.My only moan regarding this hotel is only having one lift for all the floors and rooms. Seems to take ages for lift to turn up. Apart from that all is good and would stay again if having a night in London again.,17-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"With our rescheduled flight, we had to look for a place to stay and we found this gem through Booking.com. I've already read some reviews and a common comment is that the rooms are small. Well, they are indeed but come to think of it, since you'll be out most of the time, the only thing that you'll be needing is a bed to rest at the end of the day and your very own bathroom, right? Anyway, the room, albeit its size, is very clean, comfortable, modern-looking and automated. The utilization of space has been thoroughly thought of. It has coffee/tea making facilities, television, ac, h/c shower and basic toiletries. The bed is VERY nice. Did I mention that they have this wine and cheese buffet in the afternoon? It's located near Oxford Street (shopping!). There are also restaurants nearby and it's only a few minutes walk to the nearest tube. They can store your luggage if you still have places to go before you head out to the airport. Special shout-out to the very accommodating front desk personnel -- Pablo and Dominic. They made sure that our check-in/out and baggage handling is comfortable and convenient.",15-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
This hotel was a great location for walking and catching buses/trains. Café was adequate and staff was friendly enough. The rooms are tiny as everyone else describes. I was by myself so it was fine but I can't imagine sharing with someone. only 1 elevator so always long waits when you have luggage to take up various flights of stairs. Overall a good place and I would stay here again on my own. Had a/c which I didn't realize was going to be a rarity in the UK.,15-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"New hotel from the Z chain. Trendy check in with young hip staff but still friendly. You are slap bang at the start of soho and just behind libertys and oxford street. So perfect for a business man or single/couple who want to shop eat. Not ideal if you want to have a quiet place or for families with kids.Room was small yes but for central london perfect. Bed comfy and big for the room , massive flat screen, kettle etc. I stayed for 2 nights but anymore and i'ld opt somewhere where i had a view and near a park etc. But i would come back if i needed a quick stay and the price is the best for the quality of the hotel",10-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
Went for a work event so spent very little time at the hotel but it was perfect for such an occasion. Small rooms but really clean and modern. The complimentary cheese and wine is a nice touch. Would highly recommend for solo travellers. ,8-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"loved our stay, we were already upgraded when we checked in, the wine and cheese is a nice touch and the staff super friendly. location couldn't ask for more.rooms are very small but functionally offer everything you need, and the shower was unique. Love the massive tv that literally was so big and close at the very end of the bed.",6-Sep-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
Stayed for one night and it was more than ample. The room is very small but there's plenty to keep you busy in London anyway. If you're simply looking for somewhere to sleep and show then this in the place. Far better than the likes of Easy Hotel. The only downfall really is that there is one lift to serve all floors and it's very busy and very slow. Taking the stairs is an option though if you're willing.,31-Aug-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
Really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel is centrally located and only a short walk from Oxford street. There’s plenty of bars and places to eat close by. The rooms are modern and clean albeit small. There was free cheese and wine for guests in the ‘cafe’ every evening which was a nice surprise. The staff on reception were lovely and very helpful. The only slight negative really is there is only one lift which dependent on the time of day can get rather busy. Regardless I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend.,27-Aug-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"Nice hotel for the centre of London, rooms were a little tiny for a couple. Overall clean tidy and staff were great, a nice touch was guests were invited to have free wine and cheese put on by the hotel very nice touch. Overall please and will be back in the future.

"Myself and my wife stayed in this hotel over the weekend of 13th - 16th July, the first weekend the hotel was open.We really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The room was small but the quality of everything in the room was very good including the air conditioning which was important because of the heat.Because of the weekend that was in it the breakfast was complimentary and that was great to get. The complimentary wine and cheese in the evening was super quality.The rooms are small and en suite close to the bed but if you are ok with that then this place is a great potion when visiting central London as a couple. Very suitable for business people on their own.Overall we also found the staff very helpful",13-Aug-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"Absolutely loved our stay. The staff is very nice and helpful. I told them it was a special day and they definitely made it special and I could not thank them enough. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Super clean, perfect location and the room looks so futuristic. It was just perfect. Thank you to your staff for the amazing stay.",12-Aug-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"We stayed here for one night during August to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 And 2.I contacted the hotel prior to the visit about dropping our bags off early as we could not take them into the show and the room wouldn’t be ready until around 2-3pm. The hotel couldn’t have been more accommodating to our requests and said they would put our bags in our room once it was ready.We stayed in a Queen Size room. The rooms were small, but did not feel cramped or too small for showering, getting ready and sleeping. The shower cubicle is extremely large, with good pressure and towels were provided. The TV at the end of the bed was huge and had the Sky channels and catch up channels all to watch for free! The bed was extremely comfortable with sufficient amounts of pillows for both of us. The room has air con with a fancy electric panel to control the lights and various things. The air con stayed on all night and we slept very well. The hotel is in and around Soho with lots of places to eat in a walking distance. Although outside the hotel was noisy as it was a Saturday evening, we heard no noise from our hotel room all night.We got off at Tottenham Court Road station and walked the 0.6 miles in around 10 minutes. However, upon leaving the hotel we realised Oxford Circus was the closest station to the hotel and did the walk in half the time - it was literally only two short roads and we were back!The staff were very friendly and couldn’t have done more to help. Although we only stayed the one night due to our show ending late in the evening, it was an comfortable nights sleep and the condiments tray had lots to enjoy.Thanks for having us we will be back again soon.",12-Aug-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"Absolutely loved our stay here. Central location but not too noisy. The staff were so lovely and helpful, made our stay that extra bit special. Was my boyfriend’s birthday and a card and chocolates were left which was very thoughtful. Rooms were small but modern. Lovely comfy bed with big ‘smart TV’. Would definitely recommend and will be going back.",30-Jul-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"Just returned from a stay here. Really conveniently places for theatres and Soho. Rooms are quirky, small but enough for somewhere to sleep for a night after a show. Lovely extra touches like toiletries, cheese and wine in the evenings and breakfast but don’t expect huge rooms, that’s why it’s cheaper than most but nice for what it is. Would recommend for a night or two at the most",15-Jul-18,Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d13474415-Reviews-Z_Hotel_Tottenham_Court_Road-London_England.html
"Brand new hotel in the heart of Soho. Smooth check in process, lovely staff. We were their first guests ever so were greeted with a glass of champagne when we checked in. Excited to hear that they have complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings and breakfast in the morning! Room is very modern and clean, it is on the small side so luggage placement has to be carefully planned, and the bathroom is very close to the bedroom but it’s fine for us. Just make sure you are very comfortable with your travelling partner!! Huge smart TV in the room as well as tea and coffee facilities, USB ports, hairdryer- they really have thought of everything. Lots of bars and restaurants in the area, plus Oxford and Regent streets are only 5 min walk away for lots of shopping.Great place, would definitely stay again.
